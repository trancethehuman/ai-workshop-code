21c0bd69b7e7df285c3d1b1cf56d4da925980a68,"A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'","Works include pictures of Presidential Palace and Yangtze River Bridge .

56f340189cd128194b2e7cb8c26bb900e3a848b4,"A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted a year ago of killing his ex-girlfriend's family in a fiery attack on the family home in 2007 .

In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video .

Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game.

ce7460d21ce2336a0a8ee5812edd8b785b71811f,"The team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on Wednesday night. Stoke City beat Everton, to nobody’s great surprise, and look on course for their best Premier League finish yet – a year after their last. Mark Hughes really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this. Manager of the Year? Quite possibly. Mark Hughes looks on with a smile as his Stoke City side cruise to a 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday . He has signed with remarkable shrewdness, shaped his players into a cohesive style, and overcome the set-backs of regular injuries to key players to guide Stoke to 42 points after 28 games. His team registered 50 Premier League points in reaching ninth last term, two club records, but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher. Seven wins from 11 in the league have seen Stoke nudge past West Ham United and Swansea – both clubs with claims to good seasons. And all the while forking out less cash on recruits than Burnley. That is the bit to amaze. Hughes has committed £1.2million on bringing in new players this season: £800,000 on brilliant Bojan from Barcelona, and £400,000 on young centre-back Dionatan Teixeira from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica. Mame Biram Diouf, scorer against Everton to take his tally to seven Premier League goals? Free from Hannover. Jon Walters (centre) congratulates Mame Biram Diouf after he scored Stoke's second goal on Wednesday . Phil Bardsley, a regular at right-back with 22 Premier League games? Free from Sunderland. Steve Sidwell, who has been adept when called upon, also cost nothing after leaving Fulham. Victor Moses, whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the Britannia on Wednesday, is on loan from Chelsea. Philipp Wollscheid, who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect, is on loan from Bayer Leverkusen with view to permanent move this summer. By contrast Burnley, hardly the most lavish of spenders, have parted with around £8m on transfer fees. Michael Kightly was one of Sean Dyche’s purchases, at £1.5m, from Stoke. Stoke also sold Cameron Jerome to Norwich and Ryan Shotton to Derby County for a combined cost of £2m – so in all are around £2.3m up on net transfer spend. No wonder Hughes is being rewarded with a new three-year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days. His connections, influence, and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns. The acquisition of Bojan, once the rising star of Barcelona, was smoothed by Hughes’s association with the Catalan giants. The player’s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury, after initial struggles, a testament to Hughes’s motivational skills. Bojan Krkic hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury . Clearly the support network from chairman Peter Coates, a Stoke fan since a boy and generous benefactor, and chief executive Tony Scholes enables Hughes to work to his full potential. The foundations laid by Tony Pulis in getting Stoke up from the Championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a Premier League presence will never be forgotten. But Hughes has built on that, altering the side’s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made Pulis’s reign so successful. The four forwards in his 4-2-3-1 system are interchangeable, with Moses, Diouf, Bojan, Jon Walters, Marko Arnautovic, Stephen Ireland, Charlie Adam, and Peter Crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign. No shining lights as such, they offer a mixture of pace, nimble dexterity, and brawn. Again the cost is worth noting. Arnautovic was £2m from Werder Bremen, Ireland a free from Aston Villa. Hughes’s other signings since taking charge have been Erik Pieters, £3m from PSV Eindhoven, Marc Muniesa, free from Barcelona, and Peter Odemwingie, a swap with Cardiff with Kenwyne Jones heading the other way. Chelsea loanee Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring Stoke's opener against Everton . Hughes has spent £6.2m in four transfer windows and improved. In this climate that is phenomenal. Equivalent to one 10th of Angel Di Maria, let’s say. Stoke are not averse to opening the wallet. A £10m package for Xherdan Shaqiri was put together in January before the Swiss forward elected for Inter. But when Stoke have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge. Bojan has been out since late January after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until September. Odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury. Captain Ryan Shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet. Moses missed two months with a thigh problem, Glenn Whelan was sidelined for five weeks. Now Ireland is out with that gashed leg. Hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at QPR . There have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods. Hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope. When Muniesa and Marc Wilson were injured at the same time as Shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent Robert Huth out on loan to Leicester. But Stoke adjusted and came through. After his disastrous spell at Queens Park Rangers, it appeared Hughes’s stock had fallen below Premier League level. Coates had faith and is being rewarded. Up next is a trip to face West Bromwich Albion and Pulis on March 14. Last year’ s Premier League manager of the year and former Stoke boss versus his successor in both respects? Victory for Hughes would only strengthen that argument.","Stoke City beat Everton 2-0 to move up to eighth in the Premier League .

b5febe3ebb819b1743b6718288b2d93a41193c4f,"A team from a Spanish university . has discovered what Egyptian  authorities are calling the . world's oldest evidence of breast cancer in the 4,200-year-old . skeleton of an adult woman. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the . woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed . 'an extraordinary deterioration'. 'The study of her remains shows the typical destructive . damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a . metastasis,' he said in a statement on Tuesday. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed'an extraordinary deterioration'. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death . today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records . compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea . that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to . people living for longer. 'The team from University of Jaen has confirmed that the woman lived at the end of the 6th Dynasty (2200 BCE) and was part of the élite of the southernmost town of Egypt, Elephantine,' the statement said. 'The virulence of the disease impeded her to carry out any kind of labor, but she was treated and taken care during a long period until her death. ' The University of Jaen began the archaeological excavations in Qubbet el-Hawa in 2008 and their major goal is to reconstruct the life and funerary rituals of the governors of Elephantine and their families who lived between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen saidthe Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town. But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by . British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old . skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was . around in the Nile Valley in ancient times. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said . the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the . country's southernmost town. Her remains were discovered in the necropolis of Qubbet . el-Hawa, west of the southern city of Aswan, the ministry said. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research . agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year . in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town (pictured) Other analysis - including examination of the last food found in the stomachs of three horses buried in her tomb - allowed Dr Polesmak to formulate an intriguing account of this woman's final months alive . Last year a unique MRI scan on a 2,500 year old mummified Siberian 'princess' has revealed she died after suffering from acute breast cancer. Preserved in ice in an elaborate grave in the Altai Mountains, the ancient woman - famous for her remarkable tattoos - took cannabis to dull the ravages of her illnesses, experts have also discovered. Dug from her permafrost burial chamber on the high Ukok Plateau in 1993, analysis of her remains earlier highlighted sophisticated tattoos of 'great artistry' of fantastical creatures, while in her tomb was also found clothing and headdresses, a make-up bag, and a stash of cannabis, enabling experts to build a detailed picture of her life and looks. Separately from the MRI, academics also conclude she was a virgin who lived a deliberately 'celibate' life.","Woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, country's most southern town .

4a039636bd3f339eceb4f46312d1b2daa4fa3cf0,"A doctor who made a stand against sexism in medicine has received hundreds of messages of support from disgruntled women physicians across the world. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar, posted a lengthy post on her blog discussing how she is frequently belittled because of her sex, with people regularly referring to her as a 'lady doctor' instead of just 'doctor'. She pointed out that she has also been judged by members of the profession in the higher ranks of her hospital who claimed she got into her position because she was pretty. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar in Melbourne . Writing on blogspot.com, Dr Witt, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'Sexual harassment is every time you call me ""blondie"" or ""Barbie"", every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a ""lady doctor"" instead of a ""doctor"". 'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said, ""they shouldn’t send you up here, you’re too clucky"". She continued: 'It’s also the consultant who commented that I’d ""obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty"" (Um, maybe I’m actually good at my job?). 'It’s the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.' Dr Witt wrote the essay in response to recent comments by a respected Australian vascular surgeon called Dr Gabrielle McMullin, who suggested women should accept sexual advances by their male colleagues instead of making a complaint that could damage their career. Dr Witt, who says she has faced sexual harassment at work . Dr Witt believes that sexual comments of the kind she has experienced are causing serious damage to the medical profession. She said: 'These seemingly harmless comments, coupled with the line that we 'need to take a joke', teach women in medicine that they need to just accept everyday sexual harassment. 'And worse still, they encourage those deeds further along the spectrum of sexual harassment. 'Where do we draw the line between commenting on someone's appearance to commenting on her body to making an unwanted sexual advance? 'Clearly we're having a great deal of trouble with the grey zone, so why don't we stop subtle sexual harassment where it starts.' Dr Witt ended her blog post with a call to arms for female medical workers, suggesting that they point out sexual harassment when it happened to the person in question. She said: 'I’m going to ask you,that this week you look out for subtle sexual harassment and call it out. 'Whether you’re the med student, the consultant, the nurse, the dietician or the plaster tech, that when you hear a comment towards a woman that would not be made if she was a man say ""hey! Let’s not make jokes based on gender"", or ""I don't think that's appropriate."" 'Maybe, just maybe, the tiny ripples of change could start here.' The blog, which was posted on Sunday, has since been praised by thousands around the world. @cathimon wrote on Twitter: Excellent piece.

Referee Craig Thompson sent-off Van Dijk before making a major gaffe when he wrongly dismissed Butcher's Terrors team-mate Paul Paton.

Hoops boss Ronny Deila celebrates winning his first piece of silverware since arriving at Parkhead . That left both men sweating on their places for Sunday's QTS Scottish League Cup showdown at Hampden. But there was relief for Van Dijk and Paton as they were later cleared to play after successful appeals to the Scottish Football Association's disciplinary panel. And it was the Celtic centre-half who was left bearing the brightest grin as his side clinched Ronny Deila's first trophy as Parkhead boss with a 2-0 win at the National Stadium. Van Dijk said: 'It was quite a tough week. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. 'It would have been very disappointing if I'd not been allowed to play on Sunday, especially with it being my first final ever. 'But you know, justice was served and I was able to play. Luckily I got the red card overturned and we did a good job.' The Dutch defender was sent off for a clash with Callum Butcher in Scottish Cup quarter finals . Van Dijk is sent off but was later cleared to play on Sunday following a successful appeal . Dundee United's Paul Paton also had his red card rescinded after being wrongly sent off . Van Dijk has been linked with summer moves to south, with Barclays Premier League high-flyers Arsenal and Southampton monitoring his progress. But for now the 23-year-old is happy to enjoy Celtic's treble chase. 'It means a lot to have lifted the League Cup,' he said. 'It's my first cup trophy ever. 'This club is an amazing place, I have always said that. I have been improving since the day came here. 'That is the most important thing for a player. If you win trophies, that's even better.' Kris Commons fired Celtic ahead midway through the first half before substitute James Forrest stroked home a second 12 minutes from time. The Hoops winger also had time to miss a late penalty as a United side that spent the last 35 minutes a man down following skipper Sean Dillon's red card avoided a heavier defeat. However, Jackie McNamara's team will go for revenge when the sides meet for part three of their four-game duel with Wednesday's Scottish Cup replay. Van Dijk said: 'We made it tough for ourselves on Sunday and should have finished the game faster in the second half. James Forrest celebrates scoring Celtic's second goal before missing a late penalty at Hampden . Scorer of Celtic's first goal, Kris Commons, celebrates with the trophy following Celtic's win . 'One-nil is a dangerous score - if they had scored one goal they would have had the believe to hit us with everything. 'At moments it looked tough but Craig Gordon only had one save to make in the first half and nothing in the second half, so I think we did well. 'It's a big boost for us ahead of Wednesday night. We can go for the second cup now full of confidence. 'They will be up for it on Wednesday night and know they have possibilities with the players coming back in to their team. 'But we need to be ready and win the game.'","Celtic defeated Dundee United 2-0 in Scottish League Cup final on Sunday .

b548af6fff8daaf4f68c71e6c94ab90f1f5d24ff,"An American woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal DUI has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an 'African potion' at a backstreet Thai clinic. Kelly Lynn Miller, 36 - a former Alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver Donald Goodwin, 56, in 2004. Miller was released on $50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to Thailand, where she changed her name to Bea, switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her U.S. passport. Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Victim: Brodie Smith went to Thailand with his girlfreind Kara Spark to attempt to kick drugs. He died after taking ibogaine at a 'clinic' run by Victor Cracknell and Mike Picone, his mother and girlfriend said. The fugitive, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the U.S. to serve her original five-year jail term. However Daily Mail Online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered Thai clinic. Australian Brodie Smith, 33, checked into the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on Koh Phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction. Miller – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two American expats. Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26 . Former life: Pictured is the gentlemen's club in Birmingham, Alabama, where Miller allegedly worked before fleeing to Thailand . All three have been accused of administering Smith with ibogaine, a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an African tree. The substance is used in tribal rituals in Gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction. However, the World Health Assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous, and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state. Mr Smith's girlfriend Kara Spark, 26, says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be Valium - during the $5,000 treatment last October. The clinic has denied giving Mr Smith ibogaine, saying the backpacker from Mandurah, Western Australia, injected himself with an overdose of ‘illegal narcotics’. Thailand's Ministry of Health took no action over the death - but Mr Smith's mother Diane Tucker has called on the Australian government to push for a proper inquiry. She has also identified Miller as Bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat's principal operators, Mike Picone and Victor Cracknell, both from Buffalo, New York. Mr Cracknell is believed to be the father of Miller’s baby boy, who was born two months ago on the island of Samui. He told Thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive, according to the Phuketwan newspaper. Miller was finally snared on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Thailand’s Krabi province, following a tip from the U.S. Embassy. Drug clinic boss: Victor Cracknell was one of the two business partners running the Ibogaine 'clinic' where Brodie Smith died. Smith's mother says Kelly Lynn Miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself 'Bea' Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Difference: This home in Helena, Alabama, is where Miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place . Thai media reported that at around 9am Tuesday local time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached her in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport. When she was unable to produce the document, the officer arrested her. The pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention, casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled. Thai authorities suspect Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to help her make ends meet. But Miller's mother Penney, 70, told Daily Mail Online she ‘laughed’ when she read about the accusations, adding: 'There's no money here to send her.' Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand . 'All my dreams now become impossible': Kara Spark, from Mandurah Western Australia, was with her boyfriend Brodie Smith when he tried to 'cure' his drug addiction with ibogaine in Thailand, she said. She went on: 'I only knew she was in Thailand because the U.S. Marshals told me. Other than that all I know is what I hear on the TV. 'She called me a few months back to say ""Mom, I’m pregnant,"" that was the first time I'd heard from her since she left. 'Had I had a chance to speak to her sooner, of course I would have told her to come back and turn herself in. 'At least I know she's finally coming home.’ Another island: Ko Phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by Cracknell and Picone, both from Buffalo, NY, was operating when Brodie Smith died. A third woman there, Bea, has been identified by the dead man's mother as Miller, who was on the run from Alabama . Miller struck and killed Donald Goodwin while driving drunk on Interstate 459 near her home in Hoover, just south of Birmingham, in September 2004. The Florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when Miller hit his vehicle and careened into him. Miller was due to go on trial in January 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty. Mission: Dianne Tucker, the dead man's mother, is campaigning for a murder probe into her son's death. She identified Miller as 'Bea', the woman at the 'clinic' when he died . She was set to report to prison but fled Alabama after making a $50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $10-an-hour job to become a ‘self-employed entertainer’ making $4,000 a month. But Daily Mail Online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute. A law enforcement source said: 'Kelly Miller is a very pretty girl from a good, upper-middle class family. ‘She's not stupid. She's entrepreneurial; she’s a survivor. She is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men. ‘This business in Thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is. She was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter. ‘There’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute. She probably carried on doing what she was good at in Thailand.’ Miller separated from her ex-husband Brett Street before her fatal DUI crash. Mr Street committed suicide in 2007 but his father Chris, 67, insisted his death had nothing to do with Miller and described her as a ‘pretty, sweet girl’. Former neighbors in the quiet Hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly. They told Daily Mail Online they suspected she used her three-bedroom, $350,000 home as a set for porn films. Business: Mike Picone, of Buffalo, NY, was the other business partner in the Ibogaine Thailand Clinic where Brodie Smith went for treatment before he died. Boast: What Cracknell posted on Facebook about what happened at the clinic . One said: 'This isn't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a Mercedes Benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend. 'I don't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes. 'We would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits. The girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes. 'The men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining. According to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries. 'She had certainly had her breasts done. They were very big - we called her Jugs.' Quasi-scientific: Victor Cracknell posted these pictures on Facebook of his 'clinic'. It did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms. The mother of an Australasian who died after attending the clinic says Kelly Lynn Miller was involved with it and Cracknell was the father of her baby . Bill Veitch, the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted Miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing Mr Goodwin had she gone straight to prison. With good behaviour he predicts Miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more. ‘If she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years,' he told Daily Mail Online. ‘Now she's got a two-month-old child, honestly I think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life. ‘It really hurt Donald Goodwin’s family when she ran. They are just profoundly grateful to the U.S. Marshals for tracking her down.’ Root: Ibogaine is made from this root, of a plant found on the banks of a river in Nigeria. It is illegal in the United States and Australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects .","Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested on a remote island in Thailand this week after vanishing from Alabama, where she was supposed to be in jail .

57f88e1055acb2b857a378a7c64de2bfd4563658,"(CNN)After months racing not only to treat Ebola but to find ways to prevent it, health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign Saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease. The trial, using vaccines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be administered in Basse Guinee, a region that has had the highest number of Ebola cases in Guinea. Another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study, according to a press release from the World Health Organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. ""We have worked hard to reach this point,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said. ""... If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history."" Patient Zero -- i.e. the first case in the current Ebola outbreak -- is thought to be a 2-year-old Guinean boy who contracted the virus in December 2013 and died a few days later. Since then, the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by WHO have come in Guinea and neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are new Ebola cases every day, including 132 in the last week of February (which is up from 99 reported the previous week). While Liberia didn't have any of these new incidences, Guinea did -- especially in Forecariah and Conakry. Still, authorities in Africa and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease. The progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases, with January's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic. This positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control, public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices. But the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive. That's why, over the past six months, WHO has been working with scientists, ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting Ebola in the first place. Health workers in the Guinea trial will start with a new Ebola case and then trace all of that patient's contacts, giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated. John-Arne Rottingen, from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said this program is happening at the request of Guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there ""vital"" to its success. ""The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let our guard down until we reach zero cases,"" WHO official Marie-Paule Kieny said. ""An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.""","WHO leader: This vaccine could be ""the first preventive tool against Ebola in history""
This trial campaign will be conducted in a hard-hit region of the West African nation of Guinea .
Authorities have had success in curbing Ebola, but dozens of new cases still arise each week ."

Silvano Espindola revealed that Falcao phoned him from Old Trafford last week before he was made to play for the Under 21s against Tottenham and admitted he felt ‘weird’ about the situation. The 29-year-old striker also expressed fears that he risked a recurrence of his serious knee injury by playing against lower-grade opposition.

Falcao lined up for United's development side against Tottenham, but failed to make an impact on the game . Falcao is earning £280,000-a-week during his loan to United from Monaco, but it looks increasingly unlikely that Louis van Gaal will sanction a £43million deal to make the move permanent at the end of the season. The former Porto and Atletico Madrid man has only scored four goals for United and has not started a game for three weeks.

We talked for about 20 minutes while he arrived at the stadium and he told me “something like this had never happened to me – I don’t know how to handle the situation, I feel weird!” ‘He was a little fearful because he is afraid of those matches with the youth teams and of the second and third divisions.

9e92dcf4f0b4792ecebf7f6990a7d2b794eb2cb9,"Officers have arrested 21-year-old Matthew Ellery (pictured) on suspicion of theft . A UKIP candidate handed his own son – a Ukip councillor – in to police after discovering valuable stock from his antiques shop had been stolen. Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take Matthew Ellery to the police had been the most difficult of his life. But he added that he hoped it would show he was capable of making hard choices and worthy of a seat at Westminster. Mr Stone is hoping to oust the disgraced former culture secretary Maria Miller in May. The father-of-four admitted he had a 'lump in his throat' as he apparently escorted the 21-year-old to the local police station. Officers arrested Ellery on suspicion of theft. Mr Stone said: 'It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do but I would do it again. I took him to the police station, absolutely. I did what I had to do. The police are still investigating.' The grandfather added: 'I made a complaint about stock going missing – whether he stole it from me I do not know yet. I will stand by him when it is all over. He is my son.' Ellery, who controversially won a place on Basingstoke and Dean Council last year, has been released on bail until after the election. Mr Stone, who was announced as Ukip's candidate for Basingstoke last year, said he was hopeful of winning the seat despite the arrest. 'It is a family issue,' he said. 'It could be very positive. The fact that I am willing to take my own children to court if they do something wrong is a positive move. I am capable of taking the hard decisions if they are needed.' Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take his son to the police had been the most difficult of his life . The parliamentary candidate admitted his action had received 'mixed reactions' from the rest of his family, with some even suggesting the move was politically motivated. He added that he had not seen his son, who uses his mother's maiden name, for a week. Ellery's election to his local council was shrouded in controversy, coming as it did after he caused outrage by branding the women in his town 'pug ugly' on social media. He also posted a message on Facebook saying that he 'felt like stabbing someone'. Mr Stone went to the police three weeks ago after finding stock had been stolen from his shop Squirrel Antiques in Basingstoke over the last year. The businessman, who also runs Stone's Fine Jewellery in the Hampshire town, would not confirm the value of the theft but it is believed the items taken amount to tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Stone said: 'The police do not know the exact figure. I know my stock has gone missing over the past year – of course I do.' Hampshire police said: 'The 21-year-old arrested man has been re-bailed pending further enquiries. He's now due to return on bail on May 14.' Basingstoke and Dean Council said it had not been informed of the arrest and Ellery had not been suspended. Ukip refused to comment saying it was a family matter. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ukip candidate Alan Stone, 50, handed son, Matthew Ellery, over to police .

faba1b198798edd16efa476899c836afbf88488d,"A self-driving car is gearing up for  a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip from San Francisco to New York that begins next week. A person will always be behind the wheel of the autonomous car, developed by Delphi Automotive, in order to take control if there is a situation the vehicle cannot handle on its own. The car will begin its journey on March 22 so that it can reach New York in time for the International Auto Show. Scroll down for video . A self-driving car developed by Delphi Automotive is preparing for a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip next week that will take it from San Francisco to New York . Delphi, a major Michigan-based auto supplier, is planning for the car to drive eight hours a day for eight days. The autonomous vehicle will mainly stick to the highways, where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance from other automobiles all on its own. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens told WIRED the road trip will be the 'ultimate test' for the vehicle, as it will be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather. It's design is based on a 2014 Audi SQ5. According to Delphi officials, the road trip will be the longest automated drive ever attempted in North America. In 2010 an autonomous van created by Italian company VisLab completed an 8,000-mile journey from Europe to Shanghai for three months. Unlike Google's driverless car (pictured), Dephi's vehicle senors are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. Although it will be the Delphi car's longest journey, it won't be its first. The Delphi vehicle has driven around the company's Silicon Valley office and has already completed a trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But the car really earned its stripes when, during a demonstration at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January, it braked by itself as two drunk men stumbled into the street in front of it. Delphi says the vehicle is capable of making complex decisions, like stopping and then proceeding at a four-way stop, merging onto the highway or maneuvering around a bicyclist or a trash can. When the car wants the driver to resume control, it uses a verbal warning and flashes lights on the dashboard. Although most experts say a true driverless vehicle is at least a decade away, Delphi's autonomous automobile is helping the technology look more like a regular car. Unlike other driverless cars developed by Google and Honda, the lidar sensors on Dephi's vehicle are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. The car also has cameras throughout, including one that watches the driver. Because lidar systems can cost around $70,000 apiece, they drive up the price of the autonomous prototypes. But Delphi engineer Doug Welk said one of the reasons for the road trip is to help decide what combination of sensors is best suited for the car, which will ultimately help lower costs. Delphi estimates it will cost around $5,000 to make a vehicle almost fully autonomous by 2019. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens said the road trip would be the 'ultimate test' for the autonomous vehicle, as it would be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather .","The Delphi Automotive car will drive eight hours a day for eight days .

The company asked for them to be taken down almost immediately after the incident, which killed 150 people. Adverts for Germanwings with the slogan 'get ready to be surprised' are being removed from the London tube network following Tuesday's crash . The adverts, which have a picture of an air hostess as well as images of popular German destinations, said: 'Get ready to be surprised. Visit Germany. 'Enjoy the variety of Germany and fly to e.g. Berlin or Hamburg.' A Transport for London spokesman confirmed they were taking the posters down as quickly as possible. They said: 'Our advertising department was contacted by the company and asked to remove the adverts on Tuesday. 'We had 65 digital adverts that were taken down within an hour.

Well it seems Today show host Karl Stefanovic does, as he appeared on the breakfast show this morning bearing his pins in a pair of tiny black shorts. The 40-year-old gold Logie winner, who was taking part in a segment on how to be a good morning person, is known for being one of Australia's biggest jokers and he certainly got into the spirit of the exercise routines, displaying his sporty physique in a range of questionable poses. Scroll down for video . Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on Thursday's Today show . The loveable rogue, who was joined on set by co-host Lisa Wilkinson and fitness instructor Michael Ryan, turned all of Australia into morning people this morning, keeping them entertained as he twisted and stretched in his hotpants. Lisa Wilkinson could barely contain herself as she laughed through the opening half of the segment, claiming she didn't know why all the floor staff were in stitches. As the fitness trainer demonstrated the best exercises for a healthy morning routine, Karl, who was wearing a pair of Birkenstocks with socks, stretched out his legs. apparently not too concerned about his tiny shorts showing off too much skin. The 40-year-old took part in a segment abut early fitness routines . The joker got some strange looks from co-host Laura Wilkinson and trainer Michael Ryan regarding his Birkenstocks, which he teamed with a pair of black socks . During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background. Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire. 'That's not pretty, I think we should stand up guys because it's not good TV at this point in time,' the fitness guru said. 'He's like a dog about to walk up on a tree.' Karl did little to protect his modesty during the exercise segment . The trainer looked on in confusion as Karl spread his legs in his tiny hotpants . However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display. 'What? If you don't like it look away,' he jokingly said. That's when things took an unsightly turn, as the trainer introduced the lateral lunge. There was no escaping this move for Karl and he conceded to defeat as he put his hands down to cover his modesty. Twitter users loved Karl's exercise routine, with one commenter claiming she his workout made her want to workout all day long. Another user commented on Karl's disposition during the whole segment, claiming he demonstrated the Australian version of blue steel. However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display . In November, the Today show co-host shocked viewers when he revealed that he had been wearing the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air for a year, to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry. Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).' During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background . Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire . Stefanovic's experiment  sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post. Karl, whose funny streak has seen him become one of the biggest names on television, admitted on Wednesday that he once got into some trouble on the Gold Coast. Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, he was asked if he'd ever been in trouble with the law. 'Yeah I got locked up on the Gold Coast once,' he replied, with a shocked Jackie quickly asking what he'd done to land himself in jail. 'I was at Billy’s nightclub…and I went out to the foyer, and there was a big life size poster of [Australian sportsman and former ironman] Trevor Hendy – and I thought it would be a good idea to take that off the wall and run outside with it.' Karl explained where it all went wrong and said: 'Well I was so drunk I ran all the way around the block to the waiting police!.'","Today show host Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on TV .

f354360360ab62603c850af203a0484e883fa1fd,"Bosses at trendy clothing firm American Apparel have been rapped for a 'too sexy' advert showing a female model wearing a 'thong bodysuit'. The firm, which has more than 270 stores across the world, regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). In 2012 the firm had a string of ads banned in four different rulings after using photos of women exposing their breasts, showing off their bare bums and posing with their legs spread in its ad campaigns. This American Apparel advert featuring an underage-looking model has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority . And this week, the ASA again banned an advert showing a flame-haired model wearing a £30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints. One person had complained to the ASA saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was 'irresponsible and offensive' as it 'sexualised a model' who appeared to be underage. Bosses at the ASA said that despite American Apparel saying the model was 20 years old, she looked 'youthful' and that the ad was irresponsible. It stated: 'We considered the model had a youthful appearance and that some consumers were likely to regard her as being younger than 16 years of age. 'The model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible. The campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to '[depict] the thong from various angles' 'We considered that readers were likely to interpret the model's expression and pose as being sexual in nature. 'In conjunction with the youthful appearance of the model, we considered the ad could be seen to sexualise a child. 'We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offence.' It added: 'The ad must not appear again in its current form. 'We told American Apparel (UK) Ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence.' Bosses at the clothing firm said the the model was 20 and that the ad 'depicted the thong from various angles'. This isn't  the first time that American Apparel has been in trouble for their adverts. Last September, a  campaign for the fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’. Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display. In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’. It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt. The brand launched its Back-to-School range with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’ Last year, the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a 'schoolgirl' leaning over a car door . The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show. The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. Last January,the brand stirred up controversy for decking out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair. A storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York featured three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines.","American Apparel has been told off by the Advertising Standards Authority .

3b4e3959752fb438ed85b7bfd6171485225e5a33,"Coroner Mary Hassell, who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-Semitism . A senior coroner has accused Orthodox Jews of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies. Mary Hassell claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities. In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, she says she has been falsely accused of anti-Semitism and warns the situation risks becoming ‘volatile’. She says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 Orthodox Jews refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over. Mrs Hassell believes other families in the North London area she covers are ‘suffering’ because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of Orthodox Jews, whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies. But the Orthodox Jews say they are being ‘traumatised’ by the coroner’s disregard for their beliefs, forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her. Both sides will soon face each other in the High Court in a case that could lead to all families being given the right to demand a high-tech scan to determine cause of death rather than the traditional surgical post- mortem examination. In a letter to her bosses at Camden Council, Mrs Hassell writes: ‘I look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility, and protect them from bullying, intimidation and the threat of violence.’ But Rabbi Asher Gratt told this newspaper: ‘The Jewish community is increasingly traumatised by Mrs Hassell’s conduct. It’s getting to the point where elderly people are scared to die in England – literally. A pair of Orthodox Jews wait for a bus in London. In their faith, they believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin . ‘I’m actually aware of at least one elderly couple who have happily lived in the UK since the Second World War but who have now emigrated permanently due to their fear of being subjected to unnecessary delays of their funerals when they pass away – or, worse still, a post-mortem autopsy.’ The row has arisen because Jews believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin. They also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body. But when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial, a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required. This process can take several days. Following years of campaigning by Muslims and Jews – who share many beliefs on burial customs – the Ministry of Justice has agreed that all coroners in London will operate an out-of-hours service from next month. Others in England and Wales already do so.","Coroner Mary Hassell claims she and her staff are in fear of violence .

889d52651ff7b8615b5c681dbf1116c1b88fc6c9,"The biggest impression Grant Elliott had made on world cricket came when he was barged by Ryan Sidebottom during a one-day international at the Oval seven years ago and was unwittingly caught in the middle of a major row between England and New Zealand. Now he will be remembered for all the right reasons. Elliott, a little known all-rounder born in South Africa but a naturalised Kiwi, played one of the great one-day innings on Tuesday for his adopted country against the nation of his birth to take New Zealand to their first World Cup final. It led to jubilant scenes at Auckland’s Eden Park, a venue more readily associated with New Zealand’s rugby triumphs than cricketing ones, and breathed life into a tournament in which exciting finishes have been all too rare. Grant Elliott celebrates hitting a six against South Africa to put New Zealand through to the World Cup final . Daniel Vettori embraces Elliott while bowler Dale Steyn lays on the ground after the crucial blow . Elliott, 36, powered his way to what would be a match-winning unbeaten 84 in the Black Caps chase . What a day for New Zealand and what a day for 36-year-old Elliott, who had not played international cricket for 14 months when he became one of coach Mike Hesson’s inspired choices for this World Cup. Elliott beams as he meets the press after the match . Elliott will surely never play another innings like his unbeaten 84 which earned New Zealand the most nerve-racking of victories with just a ball to spare against a South African team who fell short when it most mattered yet again. And Elliott will surely never play another shot like the six that soared over the short long-on boundary with five needed off two balls from the world’s greatest fast bowler in Dale Steyn. A man who has had a largely anonymous career that has taken in Transvaal, Wellington and Surrey was humble enough to console the stricken Steyn in scenes reminiscent of Andrew Flintoff’s Ashes embrace of Brett Lee in 2005. Then Elliott talked of how much this means for a country who will now take on either Australia or India in the final on Sunday after falling short in no fewer than six previous World Cup semi-finals. ‘I was looking to hit that ball for six or four,’ said Elliott. ‘I was just going to line it up and it was going over the boundary. It means a lot to the players but you only had to look to the stands to see how much it meant to a lot of people.’ This was glorious vindication for the attacking, modern brand of one-day cricket that New Zealand have been producing under their impressive captain Brendon McCullum with players who have not always been regarded as dynamic. Elliott goes for broke on the penultimate ball of the match and his sweet strike soars into the stands . Steyn, for many the world's best fast bowler, stands with his hands on his knees as Elliott celebrates . Elliott shakes hands and consoles Steyn as the conclusion of the match at Auckland's Eden Park . The batsman sparked memories of Andrew Flintoff's sportsmanship with Brett Lee in the 2007 Ashes . Elliott has never been seen as the epitome of modern 50-over power and nor has Martin Guptill, who came of age as a limited-overs batsman with his double century in the quarter-final against West Indies. If they can do it, then why not England, if they throw off the shackles and start again in one-day cricket after their embarrassing exit in the group stages? New Zealand were in all sorts of turmoil two years ago when they messily sacked Ross Taylor as captain but what has happened since has been little short of phenomenal, and they will provide the stiffest of opposition to England in both Test and one-day cricket in May and June. Before his semi-final heroics, Elliott was best known for his collision with Ryan Sidebottom in 2008 . Then captain Paul Collingwood apologised for upholding the appeal that saw Elliott run out after the clash . This was heartbreaking for South Africa, who did little to shake off their reputation as perennial chokers on the big occasion. Yet to use the ‘c-word’ they hate so much would be harsh on South Africa. They fumbled two crucial run-out chances and then saw JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien collide in the deep (above) when Eliott offered a skyer with 14 needed for victory, but were simply beaten by the better team. ‘I really did feel the pressure, it was stressful towards the end,’ said Elliott, who saw New Zealand home in company with the veteran Dan Vettori. That was of little consolation to South Africa captain AB de Villiers, who struggled to contain his emotions after coming off second best in one of the great World Cup games. ‘We wanted to take the trophy home and lift our nation’s hearts but we weren’t able to do that,’ said De Villiers. ‘But life moves on and the sun will come up tomorrow.’","South Africa-born Grant Elliott hit match-winning 84 not out in semi-final .

The animal was tamed after being rescued as a four-month-old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner Emma D'Sylva. Since then the lovable fox has picked up a number of canine characteristics such as tail wagging, playing with toys and even walking on a lead. Scroll down for video . Beloved pet: Emma D'Sylva and Todd the fox, who she rescued as a cub and raised as a domestic pet . The 11-month-old animal accompanies Ms D'Sylva's pet labradors Sky and Oakley on walks, drawing double-takes from other dog-walkers when they see Todd trotting through the local park. He also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden, plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it's feeding time. Emma, 25, from Stanfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., said: 'Todd has been captive-bred so he has never been in the wild. 'I've had him since he was about four months old because his previous owners couldn't look after him any more. Canine customs: Todd enjoys going on walks, playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he's happy . Sleeps in a kennel: The 11-month-old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets . 'I get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him. 'He was a bit crazy when he first came to me last year but now he has a really strong bond with me and he will walk on a lead. 'He is very playful with me. He will run up to me wagging his tail when I go to feed him and he will roll over to have his belly tickled. 'He will come into the house but he has got a purpose built enclosure and he much prefers being outside. 'We got him a little plastic kennel in his enclosure with blankets which is similar to a dog bed. 'He is similar to a dog but he is a bit more hyperactive. He gets on with my two dogs, and wants to play with them all the time. Playful: The fox, pictured in the park with Ms D'Sylva, cannot be let off the lead because he is deaf . School visits: Ms D'Sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them, including Todd, into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them . 'He tries to do what the dogs do but I can't let him off the lead because he's deaf so I can't shout him to come back. 'At first he was bonkers but he is getting more used to being in the company of other people now. 'If people or dogs come up to him in the park he will lie down at first and freeze but after a few seconds he will sniff around the dogs or sit patiently.' Todd also lives with Emma's menagerie of other creatures at her three-bedroomed house including a skunk, a raccoon, lizards and snakes. She takes some of her 40 pets into schools and care homes to enable children and the elderly to interact with a range of captive-bred animals. Emma, who lives with her partner Steve Johnson, 34, added: 'Todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms. Walking companions: Todd is pictured in the woods with Ms D'Sylva's two labradors Sky and Oakley . 'He's really getting used to things now and I'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him.' An RSPCA spokesperson said there were no legal restrictions on people keeping animals and pets in England and Wales as long as they were treated well. He added: 'Foxes have not been domesticated and a fox in captivity would have the same needs as in the wild. 'Anyone who keeps these animals is under a legal obligation to meet their needs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.'","Todd the fox tamed after being rescued as cub and raised as domestic pet .

50f309d789f0a7a27ca49fb80976b6b34fd084c5,"(CNN)I met Kelly Gissendaner in January 2010 in a nondescript classroom at Metro State Prison for Women in Atlanta. She arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four Atlanta seminaries. Since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement, Kelly was particularly eager to share community with others, if only one morning a week. And she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the Bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life. That image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who Kelly is — who she has become: someone full of contagious joy and gratitude, open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry. Kelly's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband, Doug Gissendaner. A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult, yet compassionate, conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection. This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years. Her commitment to Kelly, along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns, provided steady, ongoing love that fostered change. So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation. She was, in the words of the Apostle Paul, a ""new creation"" (2 Cor. 5:17). In the theology program, Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church ""on the outside,"" as well as in prison. By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers, Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic. She asked honest questions about her relationship to God, others and the world. She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions. She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work. ""From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger,"" she said in her 2011 graduation speech. ""I became so hungry for theology, and what all the classes had to offer; you could call me a glutton."" One of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically, not only as thinkers, but also as human beings wrestling with some of life's most urgent questions. My relationship with Kelly had this quality from the start. But it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison. In her graduation speech, Kelly described this moment: . ""There came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- I was pulled from the courses. I was taken from my theological community. Being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down. ""Since I couldn't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me. Still, this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate. It was hard ... but I pushed on. I pushed on because of that hunger. That gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me. But that gate couldn't keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for, nor friendship and community. And it sure couldn't keep out God."" This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday. We continued to read theological texts together, including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories, ""the ruins of the past,"" and building from them here and now. Restoration, Williams writes, ""is going back to the memories of the painful, humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to Christ [who] comes to repair the devastation."" I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories, took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done. Indeed, the power of these moments -- when Kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins, when we spoke of God's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever. Kelly embraced what Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor-theologian and Nazi resister, calls ""costly grace."" For Bonhoeffer, ""cheap grace"" is seeking God's forgiveness as a ""cover-up for one's sins, for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free."" In contrast, costly grace requires rigorously following Jesus in a way that leads to continuous, visible transformation, what the New Testament calls the fruits of redemption. The fruits of Kelly's redemption are now well-documented: reconciliation with her children, ministry to inmates full of despair, counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others. On the night Kelly thought would be her last, she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates, urging them not to worry about her, but to be encouraged. Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, who is widely known as the ""theologian of hope"" and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010. Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave. Rather, hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now --God's intended social order ""on earth as it is in heaven"" (Matt. 6:10). Biblical hope ""revolutionizes and transforms the present.""  It is the hope of the psalmist who ""looks for the goodness of God in this life"" (Ps. 27:13).  In the words of Kelly's favorite scripture, it is a hope that proclaims: ""I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord"" (Ps 118:17). In Kelly's own words: . ""The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that, despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head, I still possess the ability to prove that I am human. Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things. But no matter the label attached to me, I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me, or anyone."" Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly's journey of hope. While I struggle to find adequate words, what I do know is that Kelly's story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits. It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance, forgiveness, redemption and hope. Indeed, even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make. Today, Kelly's life hangs in the balance. The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution, citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her. The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete. While Gov. Nathan Deal does not have the formal power to commute Kelly's sentence to life in prison, I join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation, including more than 500 from Georgia, who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save Kelly's life and to speak out publicly against her execution. I call on all people of good will to reach out to Gov. Deal and to Georgia state legislators to demand a more just, merciful, and accountable system of justice -- for Kelly and for all. As theologian Richard Amesbury wrote, ""If the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected, then none of us is without hope."" We need to hear Kelly Gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of God are real.","The execution of Kelly Gissendaner was postponed due to concerns over injection drugs .

Packages of matzos roll off the assembly line at the factory. The factory has annual sales topping $20million as Streit's matzos are sold around the country and worldwide . 'For decades, immigrant Jews and their descendants have made pilgrimages back to the Lower East Side, the Jewish Plymouth Rock, to reconnect with their history and, of course, delight in the shopping and eating that gives the neighborhood its flavor,' said Annie Polland, a historian at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. 'With the Streit's closure, you have a significant chapter of Jewish Lower East Side history closing.' Tradition is quickly disappearing in the neighborhood that was home to Jewish immigrants for much of the 20th century. Property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements. The Streit's property, up for sale, is worth tens of millions of dollars. In the neighborhood, the factory will leave behind places like Katz's Delicatessen, Russ and Daughters and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side, according to the New York Times. The pressure of gentrification, however, is not what has caused the closing of the factor, said Alan M. Adler, a great-grandson of Aron Streit, who started the business after emigrating from Austria. 'The reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us,' Adler told the New York Times in January. Worker Aharon Yakov loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine at Streit's matzo factory . This early 1960s photo shows the storefront of the matzo factory at the corner of Rivington St. and Suffolk St. in New York's Lower East Side . Another photo from the early 1960s shows a rabbi, center, supervising the Passover matzo production at the factory, and pictured right is Aron Gross, the great-great grandson of the company founder Aron Streit . For many workers like Adramov, the Streit's factory has provided a steady job for 25 years, in fact, his only job since coming to America from Uzbekistan . The bakery first opened during World War I, serving struggling Jewish immigrants. By 1925, the business moved to Rivington Street, where the original assembly line winds through four six-story buildings — once overcrowded tenements with narrow, rickety stairs that are still used. However, the 48,000-square-foot factory does not live off nostalgia, as it is a smartly run family business with annual sales topping $20million on about 5million pounds of matzos sold around the country and worldwide. The other mass U.S. manufacturer of matzos is Manischewitz, with Israeli imports and traditional round handmade crackers also filling store shelves. Demand is growing for matzos even among non-Jews who enjoy them as a healthy snack baked with no fat or artificial additives. The old factory simply cannot keep up with demand, said Aaron Gross, head of sales and marketing at Streit's and one of three cousins running the day-to-day operations. 'I'm fifth generation, and if we want this to last another five generations, we need to make sure that we strengthen the company to remain relevant in a very competitive market,' said Gross, the great-great grandson of Streit. 'The name Streit's conjures up so many happy memories of not only my childhood but of the decades since,' says Karen Kriendler Nelson, whose relatives organized a pre-Passover family reunion at the factory. The current Streit's production line dates back to the 1930s and the baking process is strictly timed. It may take no more than 18 minutes from the moment the flour and water are mixed to when matzos emerge from a gas-fired, tunnel-like oven to cool in metal baskets that hang off rusty tracks, inching slowly to the packaging operation. Workers from the Lower East Side factory have already been offered jobs at the new location (above a pallet of matzos sits in the factory) Operations on Rivington Street will continue until the new plant is up and running (above Caballeros loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine) Beyond the 18 minutes, the dough rises, forbidden for this food that symbolizes the biblical flight of the Jews from Egypt, who were so rushed they had no time to finish baking their 'bread of affliction.' 'Nothing changes at Streit's,' declared Rabbi Mayer Kirshner, who oversees the factory's kosher certification. Some of the nearly 60 workers represent a wave of immigrants from former Soviet republics, like machine operator Michael Abramov, who was born in Uzbekistan. He has been at Streit's for 25 years — the only job he has ever had in America. 'I'm not bored. I love this work. This is important. It's our religion, it's the history of the Jews,' said the 61-year-old Queens resident. Operations on Rivington Street will proceed until the new plant is running with state-of-the-art equipment that will speed up production. These are not your great-grandmother's matzos, kneaded and shaped by hand. Mass-produced and machine-packaged, they are a modern effort to preserve tradition. The employees are all being offered jobs at the new location, where Streit's will preserve its motto — 'the taste of a memory.' In the neighborhood, property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements (above the iconic Katz's Deli in New York shares the same neighborhood as Streit's factory) As the factory closes its doors, it leaves behind places like Russ and Daughters (above) and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side .","Streit's matzos factory in Manhattan is shutting down its nine-decade-old ovens by year's end to move to 21st century computerized plant in another part of the New York area .

6c1fb1595a4d6f37c008404157593011641aae22,"Washington (CNN)Democrats who have gleefully watched Republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own. As the party works to retake control of the Senate in 2016, Democrats are looking at a Senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time. It's a big shift from recent years when Republicans, riven by long-standing ideological fault lines, faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries, usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots. Memorably, in 2010 and 2012, the fights were so damaging that Republicans failed to pick up winnable Senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates. Democrats, for the most part, have not had to face the same problem. But that might be changing. While the fields of candidates are still taking shape, a platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. While many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns, none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help Democrats avoid a primary bonanza, and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity. Republican primary battles aren't going anywhere in 2016, and on the presidential level, Democrats continue to line up behind Hillary Clinton as their nominee, without a whiff a serious primary challenge. But there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the Senate, where the question is whether Democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights, jeopardizing the party's hopes of regaining control of the the Upper Chamber. ""The great irony of Democrats celebrating fissures amongst Republicans in recent years is that historically they're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the GOP,"" said Josh Holmes, a former top strategist to Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Now we're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their Senate chances."" Democrats scoff at the idea, claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a Senate win against the many Republicans up for re-election next year. Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, seven of them are held by Republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the Senate. ""Unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable Republican senators, there are no Todd Akins here, and there isn't a single state on the map with a Democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state,"" said Justin Barasky, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's communications director. Akin, of course, was the GOP nominee in Missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about ""legitimate rape."" Last cycle, Barasky said, Democrats witnessed hotly contested Senate primaries in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of those fights were in blue states, of course. But none of them resulted in a November loss for Democrats. Republicans, though, are hoping to breathe life into the narrative, especially with Democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of Florida and Ohio. ""Democrats are facing messy primaries in key Senate races across the country, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight,"" said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""The infighting is so bad that it's not just limited to candidates in key races, but is even playing out between Harry Reid and the DSCC in Washington."" The most crowded lane, for now, appears to be in Maryland, where five-term Sen. Barbara Mikulski is retiring. In a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections, the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office. With the exception of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, nearly every Democrat in Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the Senate seat. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake have also been floated as contenders. Despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates, the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party's play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed Rep. Chris Van Hollen for the seat, a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner. The DSCC, however, has not picked a side in the race. Progressive groups, meanwhile, have championed a known figure from their community: Rep. Donna Edwards, who joined the race last week vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, ""no ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers."" That was seen as a poke at Van Hollen, who said in 2012 he was ""willing to consider"" entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations. But even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities, there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder Democratic hopes in Maryland, which hasn't seen a GOP senator since Charles Mathias in 1987. And Mathias, a civil rights advocate and skeptic of Ronald Reagan, was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party. Republicans are also hoping for Democratic carnage in Ohio, where Sen. Rob Portman is up for re-election. National Democrats have endorsed former Gov. Ted Strickland for the nomination, but the news did not force P.G. Sittenfeld, an up-and-coming 30-year-old Cincinnati city councilman, out of the race. Democrats are skeptical that Sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against Strickland and Portman, but if he does, his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73-year old Strickland. In an interview, Sittenfeld spoke critically of Portman, calling him ""a 25-year creature of Washington"" who is ""out of touch"" with Ohio. But the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about Strickland's age. ""I fit the mold for new leadership,"" Sittenfeld told CNN in an interview, careful to note his admiration for Strickland and stressing that he is running against Portman. ""If you put together 100 people into the Senate, wouldn't you want at least one person from the largest generation in American history, the most technologically savvy generation in American history?"" Sittenfeld asked. ""How can we invest  in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles?"" As in Maryland, there appear to be no major early-stage differences between Strickland and Sittenfeld on the issues, which again suggests that the Democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else. With a presidential election on the ballot, increased voter turnout is expected to give Democrats a lift in the general election. ""There is an ideological reason for running, but let's not separate that from a path to victory,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Gonzales & Rothenberg Report. ""Primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity. Democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle, specifically in Maryland. The Democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because Maryland is a Democratic state. Lots of candidates see paths to victory and think, 'Why not me? Why not now?' "" And while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines, the contests are not necessarily damaging, Gonzales said. ""Crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that a party can't win."" Brad Todd, a Republican consultant who worked on several top tier Senate races in 2014, said the primaries might boost Democrats. ""Some of those primaries will animate elements of their base, including some donors, more than the general elections,"" he said. But Todd said the rush of primary activity for Democrats does not compare to the pitched tea party-versus-establishment battles that have roiled his party for years. ""I don't see that happening with Democrats as much as it does with Republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals,"" he said. ""There's no such thing as a centrist Democrat anymore, so there won't be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries.""","Recently, it's been Republicans who have been in attention-getting, bruising primaries .

057123b34979f7c0bdc7ba28af13c1eb2ec215d9,"The Internal Revenue Service's $10.9 billion annual budget is so puny that it's ignoring 60 per cent of phone calls from people who are working on their tax return who have questions in advance of the April 15 filing deadline. John Koskinen, the agency's commissioner, said Tuesday during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that $346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service.' 'This year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season,' Koskinen said. 'As a result, the phone level of service is now below 40 per cent.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CRY POVERTY: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a National Press Club audience that $10.9 billion is too small a budget to guarantee that taxpayers who call with questions hear a voice on the other end of the line . 'TIS THE SEASON: Tax returns for 2014 are due on April 15 . 'That means that six out of every 10 people who call can't reach a customer service representative,' said Koskinen. 'This truly is an abysmal level of service.' Koskinen wasn't ceding new ground in Americans' hate-hate relationship with the IRS. He was arguing that Congress should give his agency more money. 'We are aware of taxpayers lining up outside some of our offices many hours before they open,' he said. 'You would think, in fact, we must be selling something like the Apple watch when you look at the lines. This is not a new story this year; it’s just gotten worse.' Overall, Koskinen complained, 'the IRS is now the lowest level of funding since 2008,' resulting in 'fewer audits and collection cases' and costing the U.S. Treasury at least $2 billion in revenue. CAN'T BE ABOLISHED: Presidential canididate Sen. Ted Cruz (pictured in New Hampshrie on March 27) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the IRS, but Koskinen said Tuesday that it can't be done – although 'you can call it something other than the IRS if that makes you feel better' Congress has weighed that number, though, against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers. In 2013, the last year for which reliable numbers are available, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves. Law enforcement crackdowns have taken 'a lot of the amateurs off the street, but we are clearly dealing with organized crime syndicates here and around the world,' the commissioner said. And the IRS itself gets 'millions of attacks on our system every year,' he griped, due to some software packages the IRS has been using since 'when JFK was president.' 'About the only good thing you can say about them,' Koskinen joked, 'is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works.' The IRS has been hammered in recent years after investigations revealed lavish spending on employee conferences for its employees, including one featuring am expensively produced Star Trek parody video. Another bone of contention among lawmakers who set Koskinen's budget has been the practice, now discontinued, of paying performance bonuses to at least 1,100 agency employees who themselves owe delinquent taxes. THE IRS, the federal government agency Americans most love to hate, has had its wings clipped by Congress following a series of spending scandals including lavish employee conferences and bonuses paid to tax cheats . Rhode Island Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw, who chairs the congressional appropriations subcommittee that oversees the IRS, warned the commissioner this year that the House of Representatives nas taken note. 'We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,' Crenshaw told him, because you don’t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.' Tax returns for individual filers are due in two weeks, but six-month extensions are available. Still, most Americans find America's tax laws confusing enough to rely on tax-preparation software or professional preparers to help them navigate the waters, leading to frustration and now-legendary resentment. 'The IRS code is longer than the Bible,' Koskinen said Tuesday, 'with none of the good news.'","John Koskinen revealed the startling statistic during a speech at the National Press Club .

1b7fa41fe8546787903a66933c92298127086033,"If you’re a Saturnian, it’s time to reset your clocks because it’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought. Saturn’s rotation period - the time it takes to rotate once around its axis - has been notoriously difficult to estimate in the past because of the planet’s unique properties. But using measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, scientists have determined a more exact value for a day on the planet. Scientists in Israel have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet (shown). Previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds. But new figure of 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate. This is based on measuring its gravitational field, shape and density . The research was carried out by scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft had estimated Saturn's day at 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s. In 2006, astronomers used more advanced equipment to measure the planet's rotation ending up with a measurement of about 10 hours and 47 minutes. But an estimate that was 12 minutes shorter in 2009 only added to the confusion. Mercury: 58 days and 15 hours . Venus: 243 days . Earth: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds . Mars: 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds . Jupiter: 9.9 hours . Saturn: 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds . Uranus: 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds . Neptune: 16 hours, 6 minutes and 36 seconds . The new method, though, provides what might be the most accurate reading so far. Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The same formula came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Saturn’s magnetic pole is aligned with its rotational axis and this means - unlike Jupiter - its rotation period cannot be calculated using the magnetic field alone. But verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn. Alternative methods such as measuring Saturn’s radio emissions or wind field, or tracking the planet’s clouds, had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes. The same method came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter (pictured) - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn and come up with the revised estimate . Scientists used measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, some of which was gathered by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit (artist's illustration shown) ‘The alignment of Saturn’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period,’ said planetary scientist Dr Ravit Helled of Tel Aviv University. ‘Here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds (plus or minus 46 seconds) based upon an optimisation approach using Saturn’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. ‘To validate our method we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.’ Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The study, published online in Nature, could be used in the future to derive the rotation period of other giant planets and planets outside our solar system.","Scientists in Israel have revealed new rotation speed for the ringed planet .

001db2e0e30e54bc5effda388ffb51425d018caf,"A New Zealand bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court Tuesday for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar's Myanmar owner and manager, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. Blackwood, who has a seven month old daughter, along with 40-year-old bar owner Tun Thurein and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, have been held in Yangon's notorious Insein prison since their arrest in December. Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . The trio, who all denied the charges, were sentenced to two years in jail for insulting religion through written word or pictures and a further six months for breaching local authority regulations. Both offences carry the punishment of hard labour. They were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants.

VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","Philip Blackwood was jailed for two and a half years with hard labour .

Instead, she says the company relies  on a secretive 'shoulder tap' process that allows few women to achieve the top engineering positions. In the legal papers Miss Huang allegedly argues that 79 per cent of Twitter's leadership team is male, according to Mashable. Miss Hiss Huang complained to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured . Miss Hunag is one of Twitter's oldest employees after joining the firm in October 2009. She was put on leave after she raised a grievance with CEO Dick Costolo about her lack of promotion and quit in June 2014. 'Despite being one of Twitter's oldest employees, Ms. Huang's career at Twitter was irreparably derailed for making a complaint, court documents says, according to Business Insider. 'After three months without explanation as to the status of the investigation, or mention of any possible time frame for her return to work, she felt she had no choice but to leave the company for the sake of her career.' She is now seeking other employees at the firm who feel they have been passed over for promotion to join her in the lawsuit. A spokesman for Twitter said Miss Huang had resigned and was not forced out. 'Twitter is deeply committed to a diverse and supportive workplace, and we believe the facts will show Ms Huang was treated fairly,' they said. Miss Huang started her legal action as the case was being heard of Ellen Pao, a former partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, who is suing for sexual discrimination. During the high-profile trial in San Francisco she has claimed she was passed over for promotion because she is a woman. She alleges that she was fired in 2012 after she complained. The firm deny her claims of sexual discrimination and harassment. At the weekend a judge denied a request by lawyers for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to have Pao's demand for unspecified punitive damages thrown out. Judge Harold Kahn said: 'There is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Kleiner Perkins engaged in intentional gender discrimination by failing to promote Ms. Pao and terminating her employment,' the judge said in the one-paragraph decision. Pao can seek punitive damages that could add millions of dollars to a possible verdict in her favour. She is seeking $16 million in lost wages and bonuses. Meanwhile, Facebook is also facing a lawsuit from former employee and program manager Chia Hong. According to the complaint she has filed with San Mateo Court, she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children's school, forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, pictured left, and Chia Hong, a former Facebook employee, pictured right,  have put the spot light on gender discrimination in Silicon Valley . A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told Recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender, diversity, and equality. 'In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts,' the spokesperson said 'and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly.'","Female engineer Tina Huang is suing Twitter for gender discrimination .

The Cherries were in cruise control at the Goldsands as they secured their third straight victory which condemned the Tangerines to a fifth consecutive defeat. Basement side Blackpool came in search of their first win in eight matches but any hopes were dashed after just 10 minutes. Brett Pitman fires Bournemouth into the lead at Goldsands as he scored a first-half hat-trick on Saturday . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Elphick (Stanislas 63), Cook, Daniels; Ritchie, MacDonald, Surman, Pugh (Smith 62); Pitman, Wilson (Rantie 79) Subs not used: Camp, Rantie, Fraser, Ward, O'Kane .

Referee: Chris Sarginson . Attendance: 10,013 . Jersey-born striker Pitman was afforded time and space to run past a sea of Tangerine players before slotting past goalkeeper Elliot Parish. Pitman turned down Blackpool in favour of a move to Bristol City in 2010 and ensured the Seasiders - without an away win all season - had another miserable trip home. Blackpool's first attack on Artur Boruc's goal came after 22 minutes when debutant Michael Jacobs won his side a corner which came to nothing. Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick could have doubled his side's lead after 28 minutes but he headed over from a Matt Ritchie free-kick. Tangerines supporters jeered their side and chairman Karl Oyston throughout and had only Andrea Orlandi's wayward effort to get excited about. Pitman (centre) runs away in celebration as the Blackpool players watch on in frustration at Goldsands . He scooped over after Nathan Delfouneso backheeled for the Seasiders skipper after 31 minutes. A minute later Tom Aldred cleared the ball after Ritchie had teed up Pitman inside the box. But Pitman was not kept at bay long and scored two goals in two minutes to complete his hat-trick inside 39 minutes. The Cherries striker first headed back across goal from a Ritchie cross before drilling low past Parish from a free-kick routine. Eddie Howe's side continued their dominance in the second period as they found the net once more four minutes into the second-half. Blackpool midfielder Orlandi tripped winger Marc Pugh in the box and Callum Wilson scored his 19th of the season from the resulting spot-kick. Blackpool manager Lee Clark instructs his side during the comprehensive 4-0 defeat at Bournemouth . Ritchie easily evaded Tangerines defender Charles Dunne before finding Pitman once more who skewed over on 59 minutes. Bournemouth were in total control and manager Howe even opted to withdraw skipper Elphick after just an hour as the Cherries began to ease off. Substitutes Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith did combine with the latter's effort forcing Parish into a smart save with 15 minutes to go. Smith then ran past Dunne before the legs of Parish kept out his effort. The Tangerines are the lowest scorers in the division and failed to register a single shot on target at the Goldsands. Blackpool striker Delfouneso went closest when he headed wide on 78 minutes after Orlandi whipped in a free-kick. The Cherries won 6-1 away at Blackpool in December and almost echoed that goal haul when Stanislas and Pitman both went close in the final minutes before Blackpool defender Aldred blazed over his stoppage-time effort.","27-year-old scored a first-half hat-trick to put 3-0 up at the break .

An Ohio cop has been convicted of animal cruelty for letting his police dog roast to death in his patrol car last year. Sergeant Brett Harrison will not face any jail time. His only punishment: a $500 fine and court costs. The Montville Township officer outraged the community when he left his two-year-old German Shepard Beny in his squad car for four hours with the windows rolled up last September. The dog was found dead in his kennel in the car when Harrison returned. On Wednesday, Judge Dale M. Chase ruled that Harrison was guilty of one of two misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. Following Beny's death, Harrison publicly apologized and said he had left the car running with his air conditioning on. He said he didn't mean to leave the dog in a hot car. The temperature when the officer arrived on station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was found. An investigation concluded Harrison violated policy and procedures. The police department suspended him for two weeks without pay and docked him 40 hours of vacation. Montville Police welcomed K9 Officer Beny to the department in September 2013. Beny was trained in narcotics and patrol.  When Harrison returned to the cruiser after leaving him for four hours, he discovered the dog lying lifeless in the rear passenger compartment’s kennel . Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with him 40+ hours a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. He is said to be overwhelmed with grief . Harrison issued a statement expressing his 'deepest apology' to Montville Township and to his 'partner, friend and loving family member Beny.' 'This is a loss that words cannot describe, and it is very difficult for everyone involved,' said Chief Terry Grice. 'There is no doubt that this loss will have a lasting impact on Sgt. Harrison and our entire department.' A statement from the department also said that Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with the dog more than 40 hour a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. Sgt. Harrison was overwhelmed with grief and is taking this loss very hard, the chief added. Sgt. Harrison was found to have violated policy and procedures. He received a two-week unpaid suspension and a loss of 40 hours of vacation . Sgt. Brett Harrison didn’t leave the windows open and the cruiser was turned off; the temperature at the time Harrison arrived at the station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was discovered . Police say Sgt. Harrison has been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department in 2007 . Sgt. Harrison had been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department on Sept. 11, 2007. He came to the department after serving 10 years in the United States Air National Guard, where he was deployed to Qatar during Operation Enduring Freedom. Over the years, he has received awards and praise from law enforcement leaders for his dedication in getting weapons, drugs, and impaired drivers off the roads. The prosecutor for the SPCA of Medina County is reviewing the case to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officer. I want to start by expressing my deepest apology to Montville Township, the Trustees, the citizens, the police department, my fellow officers and to my partner, Beny. I'm sorry to bringing this upon everyone. I apologize to the trustees and police department for putting you all in this horrible position. I know that it is an unenviable position to have to deal with a situation as sad as this. I'm also sorry for the sadness and grief that you were put into. Most of all, I want to say I'm sorry to my partner, friend and loving family member Beny. I wish everyday that I could go back and change that day or that I could put myself in your place. You will always be in my heart and I will miss you every second of every day. I want you all to know that I will never forget any of this. Once again, I am sorry. Sincerely, .

95ea595c04fad8bf16d9c9ce8d4a484702dc6d5a,"A British singer and her husband have been fired from their roles as judges on New Zealand’s X Factor after humiliating a contestant by launching a tirade that the show’s boss slammed as ‘completely unacceptable’. Natalia Kills, from Bradford, and her New Zealander husband Willy Moon, mocked aspiring singer Joe Irvine after he performed in a live show on Sunday. Kills, 28, accused Irvine, who sang Cry Me A River, of copying her husband’s look of gelled-back hair and a suit. Sacked: Married X Factor New Zealand judges Natalia Kills and Willy Moon have been fired after launching a tirade of abuse at contestant, Joe Irvine, on Sunday night's episode . Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River . She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband. 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back. She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' A shocked Irvine retorted: ‘Don’t you copy Cleopatra?’ In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original . Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing . Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired . You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland. She told The New Zealand Herald: ‘He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way. ‘He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, “No, no, no.” He then snarled, “That was so rude” as we both went into the bakery.’ She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed ‘you are such a c***’. The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult. But Moon told the newspaper: ‘I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.’ In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer’s letter, writing ‘not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that ""statement"" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?’ Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing. She wrote: ‘Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!’ X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair’s behalf. Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates. He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' Kills continued: 'It's absolutely disgusting... you make me sick. You have no identity... I am ashamed to be here.' Irvine appeared to take the abuse in his stride and said ‘I think I look really good’. Despite Moon having a look that resembles other more famous singers such as Mark Ronson, Olly Murs and Michael Bublé, Kills replied: ‘You look good because you're dressed as my husband.’ Both their comments were roundly booed by the audience. And fellow judge Melanie Blatt, the former All Saints singer, defended Irvine. She told him: ‘Actually, you're dressed better than her husband.’ Mark Weldon, chief executive of MediaWorks, which owns and operates TV3 - the channel that broadcasts the show - said on Monday afternoon the pair would no longer be welcome on the hit reality show. 'Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,' he said. 'While the judges on X Factor are expected to provide critiques of the performances, we will not tolerate such destructive tirades from any of the judges. 'Contestants put their all into this competition and they should expect to receive feedback and criticism that is professional and constructive. 'We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately.’ Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow judge Stan Walker will take over on Monday night. A Facebook group called 'Fire Natalia Kills from X Factor NZ' was created after the show, amassing over 57,500 followers, while a petition demanding the same thing gathered 74,000 signatures. Afterwards Blatt took to Twitter to slam Kills. She wrote: 'Ive tried to keep my cool and stay professional but really @nataliakills ? Sorry love , you're a t**t.' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Water off a duck's back... Kills tweeted shortly after the show, seemingly unfazed by the petitions and Facebook groups calling for her to be fired . Not happy: People tweeted in their droves about their disgust at Kills and Moon's comments . Not happy: Fans aired their grievances about the insults that were hurled by the pair of judges . You're a t**t!' Fellow judge and former All Saints member Melanie Blatt attacked Kills on social media . Outraged: Blatt could no longer keep her cool and took to her own social media account to speak out about the televised humiliation . Replaced: Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow host Stan Walker will take over on Monday night . Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland.

4a7b3f319f2102bebff7657f669a905bf89aeb8c,"In the wake of Manchester City’s recent Barclays Premier League defeat by Liverpool, the first thing the club’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando did was seek out compatriot Philippe Coutinho. ‘I wanted to say ‘‘well done’’ to him after his winning goal,’ revealed Fernando. ‘To me, he is the best Brazilian playing in Europe at the moment.’ Elsewhere at Anfield, the criticism of the City midfield that had started after the home defeat by Barcelona four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level. Fernando admits he is finding life in the Premier League tough in his first season since moving from Porto . Fernando (right) and Fernandinho (left) attends a Disability Awareness Workshop with local kids on Thursday . Fernando says Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, tracked by his mate Fernandinho, is the best current Europe-based Brazilian player . According to those on TV paid to know, City had lost back-to-back games simply because of failings in central midfield. Fernando played in the first game and not the second. Was he, therefore, at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage City’s aspirations at home and in the Champions League? Fernando: 'I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem' ‘It’s really hard,’ Fernando admitted on Thursday. ‘I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem. The Premier League is very challenging. ‘This season has gone OK, I think, but I’m hoping my next season will be a lot better. It was really difficult against Barcelona. We were not playing a normal team. ‘We want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the Champions League. We know we can win in Barcelona. But having an attacking mentality won’t help us if we go over the top with that. Our mentality has to be right. ‘The criticism will always come if things aren’t going well. It can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield. It shouldn’t do but that is just what happens.’ City’s shot at European redemption comes next Wednesday at the Nou Camp. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trail 2-1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated Premier League representative in the last eight. At home, City trail Chelsea in the Premier League by five points and have played a game more. On Tuesday, Fernando watched Jose Mourinho’s team exit Europe in a rather feisty game at Stamford Bridge. On a night more memorable for needle than football, it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea were beginning to show signs of frailty. The Brazilian midfielder has come under fire as part of the under-performing City midfield, but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in Manchester . Fernando, who says mentality will be the most important factor for City in their bid to turn around a 2-1 margin against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16, attempts to play football with a blindfold . Certainly Fernando revealed he could not imagine his City team-mates hounding a referee in similar fashion. He did, however, have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as David Luiz, Oscar and Thiago Silva - behave the way they do. ‘It’s not something that would happen in our team,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch. ‘We play according to whatever happens and we don’t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way. The 27-year-old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of City in the Community . ‘Every player has to hold things in. There are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not. ‘At City I follow the example of people like James Milner, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta. They are players who just try to play and not talk too much. ‘But you have to understand that the Champions League is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on Tuesday. ‘It was two great teams wanting to go through. ‘The players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too. ‘The players were tense and that’s why these things happen. It’s adrenaline and tension.’ On Thursday at City’s training base, Fernando and his team-mate and fellow Brazilian Fernandinho took part in a Disability Awareness Workshop with local schoolchildren organised by the club’s City in the Community scheme. So close are the two that when Fernandinho was chosen for random doping after training, his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event. Fernando was also there at Anfield, of course, when Fernandinho and City captain Vincent Kompany had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong. ‘In every team and every player there is a need to talk,’ he said. ‘It has to happen. It helps. We are working to improve when things are going wrong. It’s a quality and we will carry on with that. 'Fernandinho isn’t even a tiny bit upset about. It’s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us.’ Back at home in Brazil, they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day. That came last July when the national team flunked a World Cup semi-final, losing 7-1 to Germany. Fernando watched that game in a Brazilian restaurant in Manchester and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday. Now 27, he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn. Chelsea players remonstrate with referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends of Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Fernando attempts to hold off Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso as he continues to find his feet in England . ‘It is really hard for Brazil now,’ he said. ‘We have had to learn a lesson from what happened. ‘The Germans and the Dutch have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up. ‘Tactically we have fallen behind. If I get called up then of course I will be extremely happy. I am focused on my performance here, though. ‘Every players needs time to get settled and get his status. This is what I am doing.’ Isaias paved the way for Brazilians in the Premier League on his signing with Coventry in 1995 . FIRST BRAZILIAN IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE (AND FIRST GOAL SCORER): . Isaias Marques Soares, aka Isaias, signed for Coventry from Benfica in the summer of 1995.

A Bitcoin is a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation computers can break. Each Bitcoin is a piece of code that has been generated through computer processing, known as 'mining'. Once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash. Bitcoin operates as a two-way currency which can be exchanged for dollars, and vice versa. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery, but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Users choose a virtual wallet  which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. The app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software, which includes the Jawbone UP3 and Mio. As the wearer exercises, the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm then converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins.

Although this is a low amount, the technology is a concept so needs some refinement. Plus the more energy a user expends, the more money they make. As the wearer exercises, the tracker sends heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins .

The current Queensland Reds player pleaded guilty to the downgraded charges, after he had originally been charged with supplying the illicit drug. The fine of $2500 is substantially less than the amount Hunt paid for the drugs, which have a street value of roughly $300 per gram. Later in the afternoon, the Australian Rugby Union came down much heavier on Hunt, hitting him with a six-week ban and $30,000 fine. He also stood down from his position of vice-captain at his club. Scroll down for video . Football star Karmichael Hunt was all smiles as he left court without a conviction, after he earlier pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. Hunt arrives in court prior to pleading guilty to four counts of cocaine possession. All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall. Hunt accepted the blame for his actions and apologised to his team and to fans of the game. 'I made a terrible mistake last year and have no one but myself to blame for this situation,' Hunt said in a statement issued this afternoon. 'I am genuinely sorry for the distress I have caused my family, friends, team mates, Reds members, sponsors, fans and the wider rugby and sporting community in Queensland and beyond. Earlier in the day, Hunt said he was 'relieved' with the court's decision. 'I'm looking forward to putting his part of the process behind us and moving on,' he said. Hunt is scheduled to have an official press conference on Friday, but speaking outside of court he was 'relieved with the outcome'. Mr McDougall did not dispute the facts presented by police, and said they were the results of 'poor choices' by his client. 'He'll be paying for those choices for the rest of his life,' Mr McDougall said. 'He has suffered significant economic loss....it's an enormous economic loss. 'This has been a massive, massive wake-up call to him.' ARU boss Bill Pulver expressed his disappointment with Hunt, but said the sport will stand behind the embattled player. 'Illicit substances have no place in Rugby,' Mr Pulver said in a statement. 'However we acknowledge that he is sincerely remorseful and has cooperated with the investigation and our integrity enquiries throughout this process. Karmichael has also accepted the penalty and consequences of his actions and understands the requirements of a professional athlete and the expectations of our code.' The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, from former NRL players.

But while the beautiful and headstrong leading lady Demelza won over millions of fans, one man was furious with the depiction: Poldark's original creator Winston Graham. The author was 'livid' with the way the BBC portrayed the impulsive servant from his series of historical novels as promiscuous, and wanted the show pulled from the screens. Anthony Robin Ellis as Captain Ross Poldark and Angharad Rees as Demelza in one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, Poldark . Demelza was memorably played by flame-haired Angharad Rees. Graham's daughter Rosamund Barteau made the revelation to The Mail on Sunday, as a much-anticipated remake starts tonight. 'Father blew a gasket when he saw the first episode of the original series,' she says. 'He was so angry about the way they had changed Demelza into a floozy that he wanted to get the production halted. 'He was absolutely livid. In the novel she was a spirited tomboy, but the producers had some salacious need to make her sexually loose. Poldark's original creator Winston Graham  was furious with the depiction of character Demelza, pictured is the author's wife Jean Graham . 'In one scene she even offered to pull down her knickers for a shilling. That certainly was not in the books. 'Father, fearing the other episodes would be more like a bad romance novel, tried everything he could to stop the show from airing. But he did not have any editorial control. 'It was not until the second series that he was able to have any input.' But Graham came to embrace the show, which was a runaway success on both sides of the Atlantic. Rosamund – who now lives in Idaho after marrying an American – cannot remember a time when Poldark was not a part of her life. 'As a child I knew it was important not to play too loudly, when dad was locked in his study,' she recalls. 'We lived in a lovely Cornish village and at those times I usually took myself off to my friend's house. 'Father woke up early, went into his study and wrote something every day. And every afternoon would have tea with my mother for an hour, when he would bounce ideas at her.' Remake: The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis . 'Father was the author, but she helped with some of the details because she was very observant. 'She saw everything and remembered it all. She had an eye for detail and could help my father with his writing. She had the most amazing sense of humour, too. Rosamund Barteau is keeping her father's creation alive – by running a Poldark-themed guesthouse in Idaho. The bedrooms, arranged around a central swimming pool, are named after the story's four main characters. 'Americans love themed vacations, and Poldark was a hit on US TV and sold well on video,' she says. 'It has a good following in the States.' 'I was in my late teens when I was old enough to read my father's novels. I am very pleased that they have stood the test of time and a new generation will be able to enjoy the series – and the books.' The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. He returns from the American War of Independence to find his father dead, his house wrecked and his sweetheart engaged. His romance with Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is again at the heart of the series. 'I've seen the first episode with Aidan and I could sit and watch it again and again,' says Rosamund. 'I think my dad would be very proud of what the BBC have done. Eleanor's Demelza is wonderful and her Cornish accent is good. It isn't too strong but enough to know where she is supposed to be from.'","Poldark's writer Winston Graham was 'livid' with BBC depiction of Demelza .

Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. Scroll down for video . The foundations of an ancient palace in the Assyrian city of Khorsabad which has reportedly been looted and destroyed by Islamic State militants near the Iraqi city of Mosul . The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls at Khorsabad are now displayed in museums around the world including these Assyrian winged bulls now housed in the British Museum in London . Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was also investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Yesterday, officials officials  reported the jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said.

Fatally injured: The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body. He is heard begging passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The man died the following day . The explosive blast was also seen by locals at the same time as the electricity cut out throughout the Witbank suburbs. As they rushed over to see what had happened they saw the man smoking and shouting for help as he climbed out of the Botha substation in the city's Lynnvill suburb. According to the local council's acting municipal manager Theo van Vuuren, the thief had probably been attempting to repeat the success of an earlier theft at the same substation. During that incident electrical wiring was stolen leaving the areas of Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity. 'Today a thief attempted to steal and vandalise Botha substation, only weeks ago this same substation was hit leaving Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity,' van Vuuren said. 'The team has managed to restore power to Lynnville and part of Ackerville. After restoring power a cable fault emerged and this is affecting part of Ackerville as well as Thushanang.' He did not comment on the video footage of the young thief that appeared a short while later showing people refusing to assist the man as he screamed in pain and shouted for help. One eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said: 'The man came out of nowhere and was screaming, obviously in a lot of pain. His whole body was burned, the skin was left hanging off his body and some of his hair also burnt off.' Several community members came out to see why he was shouting but no one wanted to help the poor man. They were all staring at him,' he added. Video of the incident captures locals shouting: 'What were you doing? You brought this on yourself, what were you doing in the substation?' 'I am burning, I am dying and it is so painful, please get an ambulance,' the horrifically injured thief shouted back. According to the source, the man walked 500 metres to the clinic where the nursing staff called an ambulance. He was taken to a nearby hospital but is understood to have died the next day. The local police spokesperson colonel Leonard Hlathi said that they had not had any reports about the theft and the dead man's identity remains unknown.","Young thief was horrifically burnt in the outskirts of the city of Witbank .

Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions. Orders: The school (pictured logo) gave detentions for the class of 30 children that skipped lessons after warning about looking at the eclipse with the naked eye . Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’ The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye. Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’.

College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen standing at a bus stop opposite the store. Middlebury police chief Tom Hanley said at a press conference on Tuesday that Durst's name was first connected with the missing girl in 2012, following a tip from a member of the public about him owning the store but who was unaware of his link to Schulze. Investigators searched Durst's former property in the area last year but found 'nothing of interest in this case', the chief told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Scroll down for video . College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen at a bus stop opposite the store after buying prunes inside . Robert Durst and his first wife, Kathleen McCormack in an undated picture. The couple lived in Vermont in the early seventies around the time a teenage girl vanished from the area. Kathleen Durst later went missing in 1982. She has never been found . On the day she vanished, Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was seen at 12.30pm across the street from Durst's store at a bus stop, eating prunes she had bought inside. She was trying to catch a bus to New York City on December 10, the case's lead detective Kristine Bowdish said on Tuesday, but it had already left. The teen returned to her nearby college dorm room at 12.45pm and remained there for ten minutes. At 1pm, her final exam began but she did not attend. At 2.15pm she was seen once again at the bus stop across from the health food store. She has not been seen since. Miss Schulze was last seen wearing blue jeans, a maroon sweater, parka and boots. She was 5'2', around 105lb and had severe acne at the time. All her possessions including her ID were left at her college room. She was not reported missing until December 16 when her parents, who lived in Simsbury, Connecticut, contacted police. Fellow students had not noticed she was missing for several days in the ebb and flow of the end of term. Middlebury Police Detective Kristine Bowdish points to a photograph of the building where Robert Durst owned the All Good Things health food store in the 1970s. The store is near where Middlebury College student Lynne Schulze, was spotted December 10, 1971, the day she was last seen . Her parents had asked that their daughter's disappearance be kept quiet for several weeks. It was finally made public on January 24, 1972. Durst, who owned the Middlebury health store for two years and lived in the area with wife Kathleen, was not questioned in 1971, police said on Tuesday. The original investigator in the case has been dead for 20 years. Police admitted there was no indication that Miss Schulze and Durst had ever met or interacted. However Chief Hanley said that Durst was 'a person who had a proximate connection with the missing person' and that they were cooperating with other agencies, including the FBI, for an opportunity to talk with the 71-year-old real estate scion. 'When it involves Robert Durst, it's a broad scope we have to deal with on this,' Hanley said. He added that police had been 'following the news...and trying to get as many memories going as possible'. The student's disappearance was classed as an open missing person case and a possible homicide. Chief Hanley said there was 'assumed wrongdoing'. The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 after police received several leads but they came to nothing. Robert Durst (pictured left in a court sketch this week and right, leaving a hearing last week) is wanted for questioning by police in Middlebury, Vermont after being connected to a missing girl . The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York . It was not until 2012 that a citizen called Middlebury police and told them Durst had owned the store. Durst, is currently awaiting extradition to California to face a murder . charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans. Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx', must remain in Louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, a judge ruled, finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others. Middlebury police said the 2012 tip about Durst did not come from the producers of the HBO show. Both of Lynne Schulze's parents had passed away without ever knowing what happened to their daughter. Her brothers and sisters were 'very interested in the Robert Durst lead', police said. The family has also asked for privacy. Chief Hanley said: 'I've got an 18-year-old woman who disappeared, who didn't deserve to disappear. 'We've kept this case alive for many years and will continue until we bring resolution to her family.' Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued . his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier . this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators . wrongly interviewed him without counsel present. Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los . Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder . of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death . penalty. The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with . evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's . likely killer.

c49eafc214605c4fd905132b879b42954a584273,"Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, has been compared to Jimmy Savile by a senior BBC manager in advance of a probe into the latest Top Gear incident . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious ‘fracas’ with a Top Gear producer on ‘personal issues’, one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was ‘self-destructing’ and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson’s supporters – including the Prime Minister – to those who turned a blind eye to Savile’s appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun. ‘I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,’ said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear’s mysterious test driver The Stig. The broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer Oisin Tymon emerged. One report claimed Clarkson split Tymon’s lip with a punch, leaving him needing hospital treatment. Other sources told this newspaper that Clarkson had not been drinking – and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day’s filming. But the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon’s position to that of Savile’s victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. ‘The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,’ he said, adding that Clarkson’s support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. ‘If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile’s a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.’ The comparison will inevitably anger Savile’s victims. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said that ‘it is not just patently absurd, it’s also deeply offensive to Jeremy Clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by Savile’. The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘fracas’ was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC’s powerful director of television, were misleading. Clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with Cohen, who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies. ‘People keep saying that this is a case of Danny Cohen v Jeremy Clarkson. It is not,’ said the executive. ‘This is Jeremy Clarkson v Jeremy Clarkson… . ‘Jeremy is self-destructing. Danny is not the person who is driving this, it is Jeremy.’ Referring to the Top Gear host’s much-publicised split from his wife Frances after 21 years, the BBC chief added: ‘It is common knowledge he has personal issues; we have all read about them. ‘If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change. ‘The BBC has stood by him before when he has been in hot water… But this is more serious.’ BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen, pictured, is said to have a difficult relationship with Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on BBC One’s The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week, when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as ‘mortified’. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is to get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' BBC sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows – including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing – have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. As the row intensified, sources in the Clarkson camp gave The Mail on Sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident. Contrary to what has been widely reported, they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand – although co-presenter James May downed a bottle of white wine. Neither did Clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he couldn’t have an expensive steak. ‘Yes, it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they didn’t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult,’ said one source. Others close to the star – who has been suspended by the BBC – accurately predicted the Corporation would cast him as a man careering ‘off the rails’. Even so, the depth of the attack, and the personal nature of the comments, will surprise many – especially as, until now, the Corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry. The executive’s comments drew a furious reaction from Clarkson supporters. Perry McCarthy added: ‘This will be a nightmare for Jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the Corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature Jimmy Savile. ‘It is ill-conceived, as was the decision to suspend him and take Top Gear off the air. Jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy. ‘It’s atrocious that these idiots at the BBC are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child.’ Clarkson is accused of punching TV producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a day's filming in Yorkshire . Clarkson, May and Richard Hammond had been filming in Surrey all day before the incident. They left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury Simonstone Hall hotel in the Yorkshire Dales. On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening. A senior BBC source has reportedly told people that Clarkson's much publicised split from his wife Frances, left, could be behind his melt-down . Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC’s inquiry. It is not thought that Clarkson will dispute ranting at Tymon. But he is already said to deny calling him a ‘lazy Irish ****’. One account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with Tymon and said: ‘You’ll be on the dole tomorrow. ‘I’m going to make sure you will not have a job.’ The executive who briefed The Mail on Sunday said: ‘ [Tymon] could be in hospital because of this. ‘He is watching it all play out. Jeremy is a bit more used to it. I don’t think Jeremy has got the most to lose. ‘He has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to. The other guy [Tymon] is just a jobbing producer.’ Insiders say the BBC – which holds the rights to the lucrative Top Gear format – is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters. They say other shows, such as Have I Got News For You, survived the departure of a host and there was no reason Top Gear could not do the same. Sources said the BBC remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme, because it was not beholden to advertisers. Yesterday Clarkson looked downcast as he left his West London apartment. He declined to comment but told journalists: ‘You must be freezing.’ The BBC claims that Top Gear will survive if Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, is no longer involved in the show . The BBC disciplinary panel will be led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, who carried out the investigation into Newsnight’s false exposé of Lord McAlpine. Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the BBC about the row. Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures. The Prime Minister appeared to lend his support when he described Clarkson as a ‘friend’ and ‘huge talent’, adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left ‘heartbroken’. Clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside May and Hammond at four live shows in Norway later this month. All three presenters’ contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs. The last three episodes of the series have been put on hold. Tonight’s show has been replaced with a documentary about the Red Arrows.","A senior BBC TV executive has launched an attack on Jeremy Clarkson .

0fe70fda0a5d2b348605e6c5fc64c5907e84da08,"Mexican cockfighting promoters on Friday kicked off an event billed as the largest exhibition of the bloodsport the country has ever seen. The annual Texcoco Horse Fair, which takes places on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, will see 16 nightly bouts of cockfighting over the space of a month – all of which end in the death of one of the animals. Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition despite demands to ban the 'disgusting' sport. Scroll down for video . Injured birds are given only 15 seconds to recover, even if they are incapable of fighting back, in the brutal cockfights staged nightly during the month-long Texcoco Horse Fair . Razorblades are attached to the birds' left leg to make the fights 'more interesting' for gamblers and trainers . Trainers often spit on a rooster's head in a common technique used to anger the bird before it fights . Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition - even though the 'sport' has been met with furious protests . 'Cockfighting is deeply embedded in Mexico's rural culture', Texcoco tourism spokeswoman Rosalinda Benitez told MailOnline on the opening night of the month-long bloodsport bonanza. 'We want to showcase the proud tradition to our visitors'. The event, which includes fairground attractions and one of Mexico's biggest horse auctions, expects to receive more than 600,000 visitors over the month. 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', said Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year. 'This year they want to make clear how much the people love to come and watch quality cockfights'. While cockfighting is banned in all 50 US states and Europe (it was banned in England in 1835), it nevertheless draws big crowds in Mexico, where fans come to gamble on the fights and drink until the early hours of the morning. Male birds are vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers . 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later' The dominant bird at this stage of the fight has ripped away some feathers from his stricken opponent . Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another . A cock struts proudly in the ring, though it will only take one blow from a razor blade to strike him down . The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena before the fights . Cockfighting is also banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but the bloodsport is nevertheless extremely popular in more rural areas of the country. Indeed the cockfighting arenas, known as palenques, are often the social hubs of many Mexican towns. 'Cockfighting is a family business', said Gregory Castillo, a gamecock trainer from Ranchito Gaby, one of the eight gamecock-producing ranches competing on the fair's opening night. 'We get a good reception wherever we perform and people always come out to witness the spectacle. It always produces a good party atmosphere'. Gregory had already seen two of his prize gamecocks die against superior opponents that evening, and was engaged in strapping the curved razorblade of Mexican cockfighting regulation onto the left leg of his third bird. 'The razorblades make for more interesting fights', he told the MailOnline as he spat on the rooster's head, a common technique to anger the bird before it enters the battle. 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later'. The cuurved weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena . Spatters of blood cover the floor of the cockfighting ring, surrounded by fans enjoying drinks and snacks . The cocks often scrap furiously on the floor of the arena, which is covered in blood from previous fights . 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', according to Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year . The cockfighting areana, known as a palenque, in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration . The weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena. 'It's a disgusting practice and there's no reason that it should continue simply because it's seen as tradition', said Leonora Esquivel, a leader of the AnimaNaturalis animal rights organisation, in a telephone interview with the MailOnline. Leonora's organisation, which works closely with Mexico's  Ecologist Green Party, is currently petitioning the government to put an end to animal cruelty in the country. The group focuses particularly on bullfights, cockfighting and illegal dogfights which occur periodically around the capital. Each cockfight runs for a maximum of 15 minutes, though most are over within two. Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws is rapid and furious. The male birds are extremely vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers. Even if a bird is injured and not attempting to fight any longer, it is permitted only a 15 second recovery period before being placed within a yard of its opponent and forced to continue. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws, when it comes, is rapid and furious and fights are always to-the-death . The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome . 'Sometimes it comes down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over' A fight is declared over only when one of the birds is lying dead on the arena floor. The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome. The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena, before being placed in front of a non-competitor mona ('monkey') gamecock to allow the gamblers to gauge their reactions. 'The more aggressively they peck, scratch and display their neck feathers at the mona, the more likely it is that they will be a good fighter', said Mauricio Alvarez, an observer in the crowd who had quadrupled his money over the previous two fights. 'But sometimes it comes completely down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over'. Bookmakers patrol the circular arena taking bets whenever a fight is not in progress. The high-rollers are always invited to seats within five rows of the arena and bookies' fees are negotiated depending on the size of the bets. The month-long Texcoco Horse Fair also features bullfighting and attracts more than 600,000 visitors a year . The facade of the main cathedral building in Texcoco (left). Mexico's national sport, charreria, is a kind of rodeo made up of different equestrian competitions and is also practiced at the fair (right) Cockfighting is banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but is permitted in Texcoco, on the outskirts of the capital . For people further back in the stands, tennis balls with slits in them are thrown back and forth between gamblers and bookmakers: stuffed with stakes, winnings and losses. The palenque in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration. Following 16 cockfights, each ending with the bloodied loser unceremoniously dumped in a cement bucket, one of Mexico's most famous bands 'Los Angeles Azules' (The Blue Angels) took the animals' place to play to a packed house. The fair will culminate with three shows by Luis Miguel, one of Latin America's most famous artists and a Michael Bublé-esque crooner, from April 9 to 11. All the shows will follow directly on from the cockfights. In December of last year animal rights activists achieved a nationwide ban on the use of wild animals in circuses, imposing fines of up to £180,000 on organisations which cannot prove the domestic origins of any animals which are used in their performances. The Mexican government is currently engaged in the struggle to find homes for more than 2,000 repossessed tigers, lions, elephants and other such animals which have been freed as a result of the law. International supermarket chain WalMart was in trouble late last year as shoppers complained that a store in Veracruz state hosted a cockfight in order to promote a soft drinks company.","Annual Texcoco Horse Fair takes places on eastern fringes of Mexico City .

According to NHS, the symptoms of dehydration include 'dizziness or light-headedness, headache, tiredness, dry mouth, lips and eyes, and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently.' Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses, nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection. Combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties, like alcohol or coffee. Low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages, like alcohol, to a minimum . Ear pain . Ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing? It turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal. But it's only when this pressure cannot be released, such as due to blockage from a cold, for example, that the passenger will really be made aware of the change. Luckily, alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing, chewing or yawning. Additionally, the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears, when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence. Ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure . In this instance, the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings, which is the steadiest part of the plane. And the final ear-related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing. Whether watching a movie or listening to your iPod, the sounds you're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc, since it's a different listening environment than you're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out. Although your hearing won't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two, frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long-term effects. Lower levels of oxygen in the plane's pressurised air can cause light-headedness and shallow breathing . Oxygen deprivation . It may be a small difference, but the lower oxygen levels in the plane's pressurised air can lead to minor oxygen deprivation in travellers. This could cause light-headedness, shallow breathing or difficulty concentrating. If this happens to you, be sure to alert a flight attendant, as he or she may be able to provide you with additional oxygen or even increase the overall airflow to the plane. The lower pressure in the cabin can also affect your blood circulation, which could lead to swelling in your lower extremities - especially on long haul flights when you're cramped in your seat. Ideally, walk around the aircraft every 30 minutes, or, at the very least, flex and stretch your feet regularly. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when blood clots develop in the legs due to long periods of inactivity . DVT . Deep vein thrombosis (or DVT) occurs when blood clots develop within the deep veins of the legs, causing pain and swelling. Occasionally, it may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, which is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs. Anyone sitting for more than four hours, as most people do during long-haul flights, is at risk of developing DVT, however, certain groups may be at greater risk. Virgin Atlantic encourages anyone aged 40 or over, anyone with a family history of blood clothes or anyone being treated for cancer, heart failure or circulation problems to be especially cautious. To help prevent clots, moving around during the flight and wearing support stockings will both help to keep blood circulating. However, if you begin to feel short of breath, experience chest pain, or if your legs are still swollen after the flight, you should seek medical attention immediately. On long-haul flights, your exposure to radiation from cosmic rays, energetic particles from space, is higher . Radiation exposure . While on international flights, you're exposed to more than a tiny amount of radiation from cosmic rays, which are energetic particles from space, mostly made up of protons. The longer the flight and the higher and closer the plane flies to the North Pole, the greater the dose of radiation that crew and passengers alike will experience. While it's of most concern for those who fly for a living, frequent flier passengers will experience more of this exposure than people who spend more time on the ground. Several studies have found also that cancer rates among flight personnel are marginally higher than the rest of the general population, although a recent Center for Disease Control (CDC) report did not find further support of such a claim. However, the CDC does admit that experts are still not sure of the health risks associated with cosmic radiation and because you cannot see or feel it, often people do not just precisely when they are being exposed. Flying roundtrip from New York to Los Angeles, for example, three times per year, would expose passengers to the equivalent of 3 chest X-rays, or about 100 microSieverts. On a roundtrip flight from New York to Beijing, however, you can easily exceed that amount. Sun damage from UV rays . It is not something passengers would necessarily think to do before a flight, but applying suncream could well protect against UV damage in the skies. 'At high altitude, over 54 per cent of UVA rays penetrate glass, making pilots spending long periods in the cockpit up to twice as likely to develop melanoma,' Abi Cleeve, MD at UltraSun UK tells MailOnline Travel. 'In fact, 56.6 minutes in the air is equivalent to 20 minutes on a tanning bed.' When flying, a passenger is 100 times more at risk to catch a common cold than when not on a plane . Common cold . Finally, and what may seem insignificant in comparison to the other risks that befall frequent travellers, those who travel often may be at a greater risk for catching a common cold. A 2004 study in the Journal of Environmental Health Research found that when you're flying, your risk for catching a cold is over 100 times higher than when you're not on a plane. Take proper precautions and be sure to wash your hands frequently, and carry anti-bacterial hand sanitiser, when globe trotting. After all, the last thing you want is for a simple cold to slow you down on your next glamorous getaway.","When it comes to flying, there are plenty of health concerns to look out for .
Due to the lack of cabin air humidity, dehydration and swelling are common .
Cosmic radiation is also higher when in flight and closer to the North Pole ."

Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at a whopping 56 pounds — about the size of four or five miniature dachshunds. A series of 'before' photos show Dennis resting on rolls of fat, his head seemingly too little for his blob of a body. He couldn't take more than a few steps without being out of breath. Scroll down for video . In this June 2013 photo, Dennis, a dachshund, rests on the ground in Columbus, Ohio. Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at 56 pounds and could walk only a few feet without stopping, out of breath. But then Burton rescued him from his previous owner and provided him with a proper diet, exercise and affection . pictured on February 25, Dennis now only weighs 12 pounds and can freely play in the snow. He has had three skin-removal surgeries to remove the folds of excess skin . Then Brooke Burton adopted him from a relative who had fed him White Castle burgers, pizza and other human food, and didn't pay much attention to the dog's burgeoning belly. Burton, a 26-year-old nursing student, recalls how emotional she became when she first saw Dennis in June 2013, and then persuaded her relative to give him up. 'Out comes Dennis, and I couldn't believe it,' Burton says. 'I wasn't even sure what breed of dog he was supposed to be because he was so large.' Burton put him on diet of dry dog food, plus lots of walks and affection. Now the 6-year-old wiener dog is a svelte 12 pounds and happily chasing squirrels in the backyard, playing fetch and bossing around the other three rescue dogs that live with him. 'In the beginning, you could tell he was very depressed, that he really didn't feel good at all,' Burton says. 'He didn't have much of a personality. After he lost weight, this bossy little demanding man popped out. He's into everything, he wants to play with everybody.' Dennis lost so much weight that he started tripping over the folds of excess skin that were left over and getting infections. He has had three surgeries at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center to get rid of it. The operations cost more than  $2,800 together and were covered by a GoFundMe page set up by Burton, donations from individuals and the OSU Veterinary Medical Center, according to  the Columbus Dispatch. Dr. Kathleen Ham, the veterinary surgeon who performed the operations, says Dennis' story is a good lesson for pet owners who might feed their animals too much. 'We have an expression: Food is not love,' Ham says. 'Most of what your pet wants from you is affection and attention.'","Dennis the miniature dachshund lost  75 percent of his body weight .

742163e2d890b106ef93dcee1354deea845db7f4,"(CNN)British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. ""Just don't allow it. It's wrong. It's so wrong. Be what you want to be -- and prove them wrong."" The emotional Harry Potter star took to the stage at Facebook's headquarters in London on Sunday, March 8, to talk about gender equality as part of International Women's Day celebrations. CNN was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world --as the 24-year-old UN Goodwill Ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey. Emma's Facebook moment . Of the dozens gathered at the event, the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike Harry Potter himself. Describing the ""surreal"" moment she gave a speech at U.N. headquarters, later watched by 17 million, Watson said:  ""Gender equality historically has been a woman's movement. ""And how it's affecting men hasn't been addressed,"" she told moderator Greg James. During the hour-long conversation, Watson gave the audience a  rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism. ""I love having the door opened for me, isn't that just polite?"" she said. ""But I think the key is, would you then mind me opening the door for you?"" ""Chivalry should be consensual."" And it's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too, she added. ""I get disturbed by this idea that men can't cry,"" she continued. ""They can't express themselves and I think that's the saddest thing in the world. Being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it's not what makes you a girl."" When internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress, following her UN speech, she said it only made her more determined in her campaign. ""If they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite,"" she added. Almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign, including U.S. President Barack Obama, and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt Damon. ""I read a letter of support from a 13-year-old boy that was equally as passionate as a CEO,"" said Watson, adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night. ""I asked my younger sister: 'What would be the one thing you'd want from boys in your life?' She said: 'I just want them to play with us.' And I think that really translates at every level. We just want to be included."" Watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother, Jacqueline, who was a ""single working mother and type one diabetic."" ""She wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good,"" said Watson, adding: ""She was actually thrilled when I got my first detention... I think I failed a Latin exam."" Answering questions submitted via Facebook, Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. ""Why are women not directing their own stories?"" she said. ""The human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly. And at the moment one of its wings is clipped,"" said Watson, paraphrasing famous American feminist, Gloria Steinem. When asked what things we can all do to affect change, the actress said it wasn't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones. ""It's everyday, it's individual, it's on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""Whether it's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue."" In the audience, a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men, when they are more likely to take maternity leave. She answered: ""I don't think in the grand scheme of things [maternity leave] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field.

7f66b15837d7ff3331d15386a5ed4b97fcea908b,"The father of murdered bride Anni Dewani has today marked what would have been his daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was fixing a lift when it plunged to the ground, ripping his right arm off. He underwent a 13-hour operation to reattach his limb after being airlifted to hospital in Gothenberg, Sweden. Today, Mr Hindocha posted a picture on Facebook of himself with two nurses and wife his Nilam, a cake and treats to mark Anni's birthday. She was 27 when she was shot dead on her honeymoon in South Africa. 'Celebrations': Vinod Hindocha marked his murdered daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. He posted this picture with two nurses and his wife Nilam (left) on Facebook . He wrote: ‘Happy Birthday little Angel. Miss U for ever. We R celebrating this Birthday In Gothinburg  hospital,love U for EVER’ Mr Hindocha was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor. However, his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. His brother Ashok, 54, told MailOnline that Mr Hindocha had recovered some movement in his fingers, but will not make a full recovery for at least 18 months, if ever. Vinod Hindocha, 65, was standing in a lift with his arm extending out of the cage when a chain slipped, dropping him to the ground floor . He added: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes. 'Nilam and Vinod have had a very difficult few months. 'They are such a strong couple, they will get through this aswell. But it is a lot for anyone to go through. 'We are grateful that he was in Sweden and could get to hospital so quickly and into surgery to try and save the arm. Only time will tell whether the operation will be successful. 'Today is Anni's birthday and that fills the minds and hearts of all the family.' Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while riding in a cab with her new husband, Shrien Dewani, 35, through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town. The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack. Mr Hindocha (centre) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling. Surgeons reattached the limb, but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back . The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed) However, he also said Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage. After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year. During the short case, the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies. The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence. Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.

e866e771f1f0c8d7ee2b271cfce62e6d6a7aafa2,"(CNN)Team Cookie or Team Boo Boo Kitty? If you're a fan of the hit TV show ""Empire,"" you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series. If you aren't a fan, you may soon be in the minority. The show has become something of an industry phenomenon, with ratings growing every week. According to Variety, two weeks before the season finale, which is set to air on March 18, ratings were up 53% from its January 7 premiere in the coveted 18-49 demo and total viewership had risen 45%, from 9.9 million to 14.3 million. Eight straight weeks of growth is almost unheard-of these days in broadcast TV, which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services. But Fox's ""Empire"" is doing the damn thing. The show revolves around the character of record label owner Lucious Lyon (played by Terence Howard) and his family, which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what's hers. ""You're so beautiful,"" Empire, and here are some of the reasons why: . Taraji P. Henson . Henson has been in the industry for a minute, and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), her career hadn't really taken off. Not so now. Henson has sunk her teeth into the role of Lyon family matriarch Cookie. The character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely, even as she is also motivated by making money. The show's co-creator, Danny Strong, told Entertainment Weekly that fans can thank Henson for the now infamous ""Boo Boo Kitty"" nickname that viewers have come to love. When Cookie sneeringly calls her ex-husband Lucious' new lady love, Anika Calhoun (played by Grace Gealey), ""Boo Boo Kitty,"" you want to yell at the screen, ""Get her, Cookie!"" ""So, basically Taraji is a genius,"" Strong said. ""She's a comic genius, but she's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress, and we're utilizing all that in Cookie."" Watch for Henson to snag nominations next award season. It's old school soapy . Think ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas"" for the 21st century. It has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious: sex, scores to settle, family tensions, violence and did we mention sex? Set in the world of the music industry, there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy, dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode. That's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that ""and then what?"" itch. It's new-school hip . ""Empire"" has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern. One of the primary story lines has been about homophobia, as Lucious Lyon and his son Jamal (Jussie Smollett) battle over Jamal revealing he's gay. It comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights. Series co-creator Lee Daniels, himself an openly gay man, has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community. ""Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community, and men are on the DL (down low, meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women). They don't come out, because your priest says, your pastor says, mama says, your next-door neighbor says, your homie says, your brother says, your boss says (that homosexuality is wrong),"" The Wrap reported Daniels saying during the Television Critics Association press tour in January. ""And they are killing African-American women. They are killing our women. So I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community."" The music is off the hook . The show has managed to improve on what ""Glee"" did and succeed at what the now-canceled NBC drama ""Smash"" tried to do: fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry. Smollett has been the breakout star in this area. His mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack's more popular tunes, including the anthem to individuality, ""Good Enough,"" which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service Spotify. Superproducer Timbaland (best known for work with artists including Jay Z and Justin Timberlake) and his protegee Jim Beanz are responsible for the show's sound. Beanz told Rolling Stone the music has to be authentic and original. ""One of the things that Tim told me is, 'If it sounds like something you've heard before, don't do it,' "" he said. Of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on iTunes. Fingers crossed for a possible ""Empire"" tour featuring Smollett and other co-stars including Bryshere Y. Gray, who portrays youngest Lyon son Hakeem and who in real life raps under the moniker Yazz the Greatest. The awesome guest appearances . You could have knocked us over with a feather when Courtney Love popped up on the show. Love had a bit role on this first season, as has supermodel Naomi Campbell and '80s actor Judd Nelson. The series has been hyping appearances from music stars like Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige and Patti LaBelle. Given the popularity of the show, there's no telling who will pop up on season 2. Henson and Howard . The love/hate relationship between Cookie and Lucious Lyon is everything. They have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite. Chalk it up to the longtime friendship between Henson and Howard, who also co-starred in the film ""Hustle and Flow."" Howard told BlackTree TV that he and Henson had to do a ""chemistry read"" to show that they clicked. The end result has been magical. ""We have so much fun,"" Howard said.","""Empire"" has seen its ratings grow every week .
Taraji P. Henson's character is a favorite .
The music is a big part of the show ."

Jennifer Muhm (left) and Malorie Catchpole (right) said they came up with the idea of buddingSTEM after experiences they had with their own daughters . 'We're not anti-princess. We're not anti-pink. We're not anti-girly. We just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls,' Muhm, 37, of Shoreline, Washington, told ABC News. She said her now-five-year-old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween in 2013, but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume. 'She looked at me and said, 'I can't be an astronaut. They're only for boys',' Muhm told ABC. After seeing pictures of Sally Ride, Joan Higginbotham and other female astronauts, however, her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut, according to the moms' Kickstarter page. Muhm said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween, but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs . Muhm and Catchpole said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls' clothing, including space ships, dinosaurs and trains . Muhm told Catchpole, 34, also of Shoreline, about the issue and they were both frustrated. Catchpole told ABC that her three-year-old daughter is 'very into trains' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train-themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for Christmas, they could only find boy's underwear. Catchpole bought them anyway. 'I was actually at their house on Christmas and saw the boys' underpants under the tree, and it was that moment that it kind of clicked,' Muhm said. 'I said, 'You know what, Malorie? We should make underpants with trains on them… and then we thought why just underpants: There are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls',' she added. The women, who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear  for girls between 18 months and eight years old . BuddingSTEM - STEM standing for science, technology, engineering and math - was registered as a business in April 2014. Since the business's origination, the moms have raised more than $52,500 for the company through a Kickstarter . And so the pair filed their business registration for buddingSTEM in April 2014. 'If there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it,' said Muhm. With help from a textile designer and a Kickstarter that helped them raise $52,500 to date, the clothing line will be available in July. 'One of the things that I'm happiest about… is what I think we've shown our daughters,' Catchpole said. 'We're two working moms. We don't have a background in fashion, and we saw a need and we worked hard.' The clothing line features simply designed outfits that are easily mixed-and-matched with train, space and dinosaur themes. Clothing can come in blue and pink or teal and gray .

When a photograph of Labour leader Ed Miliband was displayed, the most popular response was 'weak' followed by 'idiot', 'Labour', 'useless' and 'untrustworthy' Like Mr Miliband, the overwhelming response to Mr Clegg was 'weak'. The Lib Dem leader has seen his party's popularity collapse since entering coalition five years ago, in large part as a result of the broken promise to abolish tuition fees.

In a sign that not everyone knows who he is, or is unsure what to feel about him, the top 10 is completed by 'idiot', 'nothing', 'who?', 'OK' and 'unsure'. Two people described the Deputy PM as a 'poodle', four said he was a 'sell-out' and one branded him a 'tosser'. One called him a 'slag', another said 'numbskull' and two said 'pillock' Popular responses to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg included 'liar', 'don't know', 'untrustworthy' and 'useless' The overwhelming reaction to Mr Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Ukip has been dogged by revelations about its candidates and members, with Mr Farage insisting he will take action against those who embarrass the party. But he has also courted controversy by defending a candidate taped mocking 'poofters', referring to a Chinese woman as a 'Chinky bird' and threatening to 'shoot peasants'. The next most frequent reactions to Mr Farage included 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot'. The top 10 responses also included 'untrustworthy', 'honest' and 'joke'. Five people said 'frog', five said 'yuk!' and another five replied 'w*nker'. The overwhelming reaction to Ukip leader Nigel Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Others called him an 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot' Daisy Powell-Chandler, a consultant at Populus, said: 'It is a fact ignored by most politicians that the public aren't paying attention most of the time. 'Voters have families, jobs and bills that are much more interesting to them than today's policy launch or staged visit.' As the election approaches on May 7, more information will start trickle through. 'But many of the electorate will be choosing who to vote for (or whether to vote at all) based on how each party leader scores on the 'blink test' – the immediate reaction when they see or hear party leaders in the media. This poll shows precisely that. 'It is clear from the results that all political leaders are polarising figures with strong downsides. People think Cameron is arrogant, Miliband is weak, Clegg cannot be trusted, and Farage is a racist. 'But the flipside of these criticisms are things we like about them: Cameron may come across as smug but he is smooth and competent – an assertive leader. 'Ed is weird but caring and intelligent. Clegg is the likeable liberal and Farage a charismatic, funny man. 'Over the course of the campaign, the electorate need to decide which of these attributes are most important and the emotional connections that the public make with these leaders are likely to be an important factor in deciding who the next Prime Minister is.'","Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage subjected to 'blink test' polling .

Ms Gibson, founder of the popular Whole Pantry app, has faced intense criticism since doubts were raised about whether she has terminal cancer. Ms Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar, told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'unfortunate' and that health bloggers have a huge responsibility to their followers. 'The real issue that's going on is there's a lot of people out there not taking on board the responsibility that comes with all this,' she said. Scroll down for video . I Quit Sugar author Sarah Wilson told Daily Mail Australia many bloggers are 'not taking on board the responsibility' that comes with publishing . Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson last week said she would issue an explanatory statement, but it has not materialised . 'I don't know that you need to be a dietitian to share information about your health journey. 'If you are somebody who works online and you claim to be a (health) blogger you have to take on certain responsibilities. 'You have to ensure you train yourself up in all of that (science). That's what I see isn't happening. 'There's a lot of people out there who are't taking on the responsibility of being a disseminator of information. 'We've got to be very transparent and acknowledge the science is not categorical - but respect the science that is there.' Ms Wilson has said in a blog about the issue that 'diet can't cure disease'. Ms Gibson has stayed mum about her health since admitting in an interview with The Australian that her previous claims cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, uterus and liver may have been a 'misdiagnosis'. In the weeks since doubts were raised about Belle Gibson's cancer and charitable donations, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books . In the weeks since, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia last Tuesday, Ms Gibson said she understood why many of her followers were upset, but she criticised the 'maliciousness' of some critics. She said she would release a statement addressing concerns about her, but that it was 'taking longer than anticipated' due to 'constantly arising issues' and articles she needed to stay on top of. Asked if the statement would address concerns about her medical history, she said: 'Of course, and every which otherwise possible.'

aa11f5cdb7409f40dd89c5b560819a6b2f1bbd46,"A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis has not yet been  introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price . A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014. The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75. Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014. 'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.' Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'

So perhaps it is unsurprising that Egyptian architects have taken inspiration from the Pyramids at Giza to create a new skyscraper in the capital Cairo. Plans for a spectacular addition to the city's skyline have been unveiled and the shape will look very familiar - not only is the pyramid building borrowing from Ancient Egypt, at 200 metres (656ft) tall, it will be taller than the Great Pyramid itself and the highest building in the country. Scroll down for video . The Zayed Crystal Spark project will feature not one, but two pyramid shaped features. The smaller pyramid at the front will boast an impressive entrance and walkway, surrounded by cascading waterfalls . The Great Pyramid is thought to have been built around 2550BC and reaches 147 metres (481ft). There are three pyramids at Giza - built as burial chambers for three important kings, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure - and they are famed as one of the original Seven Wonders of the World. The modern project will be known as the Zayed Crystal Spark, occupying a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district. It will be multi-purpose and have potential to be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures. The development would be created by real estate developers and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA). The Ministry of Housing have announced plans for a spectacular 200 metre high pyramid skyscaper, which will be the tallest building in the country. The shining pillar will be adorned with a glowing capstone and commemorate the nation's prized landmarks .

e98f71ab88cf1951cd53549071672dd62cdd02a3,"Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound . Scientists in the U.S. have devised an implant in a tiny silk 'purse' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body. Up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the UK will develop an infection, and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days. Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations, according to a study published last month. Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound. The most common culprits are Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment, including further surgery. The new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria. It consists of a tiny, magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein, and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection, the implant can be switched on using a remote control. This raises the temperature of the coil. The silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight. This is an improvement on previous medical implant devices, which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed. Researchers at Tufts University have used the implant in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes. Within 24 hours the tissue was infection-free. The device, including the coil, completely dissolved after 15 days. 'This is an important step forward for the development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely,' the researchers said. 'These wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection, for example, or pave the way for eventual ""wi-fi"" drug delivery.' The team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Stella Vig, consultant vascular and general surgeon at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection. This new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device . The concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new, and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues. These required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely. 'This new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device, which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it. 'Surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery.' Meanwhile, a team at the University of South Florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, which kills thousands of people worldwide each year. The bug is a form of Staphylococcus aureus which does not respond to the usual antibiotics. The new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines, which have been used in treating malaria and cancer. They have recently been shown to act on bacteria, too. 'In recent years, MRSA has become resistant to vancomycin, our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections,' said Dr Lindsey N. Shaw, whose team developed the new drugs. 'Bacterial disease remains the second-leading cause of death globally, especially among children and the elderly. 'We need new drugs to fight these infections.'","Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions .

A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and ­ victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud which she was later cleared of. She is pictured holding the two commendations which she was awarded by the force in 2007 .

She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations.

0ed40867896644f7d67fa2a21c99cb03425d8b5d,"It was the final minute of a one-sided game and Everton winger Christian Atsu set off on one last attack. Sprinting in front of him was Ross Barkley and Atsu wasted no time sending the England man clear. As Tim Krul raced out, Barkley danced around him, the ball never leaving his feet and - with the goal at his mercy - he gracefully applied the finishing touch. Goodison Park, at long last, was exultant and all around this old stadium, fans punched the air in celebration. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez was a little more reserved but there is no doubt a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. This was a big day for the manager and his team, but they came through it with panache. In the end they beat Newcastle 3-0 but that score might have been six. Click here to read Dominic King's full match report . Host commentator . Everton move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with what turned out to be a comfortable win for the home side in the end. The Toffees took the lead through James McCarthy before Romelu Lukaku added a second from the penalty spot. Everton's day was made easier when Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous lunging tackle on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley added a third in the closing stages of the match. Substitute Ross Barkley shows Kone how it is done by rounding Krul before placing the ball into an empty net. Kone rounds Krul after dodging several challenges from Newcastle's defenders but he runs out of space to score. He probably should have squared the ball to a team-mate but his goalscoring instinct saw him try to score a goal of his own. Atsu comes on for the final five minutes of this afternoon's match at Goodison Park. Sissoko, who is captaining Newcastle following Coloccini's sending off, made Howard make his first real save of the afternoon with a powerful shot at goal. Howard made a good save to his left before shouting at his defenders. Osman, who has been in impressive form, just tested Krul with an effort but the Dutchman was able to palm the ball to safety. The Toffees are not exactly pushing for a third goal but I suppose they are content with their two-goal advantage. Newcastle, on the other hand, are starting to tire due to their numerical disadvantage. Gutierrez replaces Riviere as 10-man Newcastle attempt to close up shop. They know they are out of the game now so it's just a case of keeping the scoreline down to as low as possible. Newcastle's day has been made even worse as their captain has been sent off for a disgusting challenge - if you can call it that - on Lennon. He was incredibly late and his studs were raised as he made a lazy attempt to win back possession for his side. Carver throws on Cabella for Ameobi immediately after Everton's second. Lukaku adds a crucial second goal by converting the penalty from 12 yards. He slots the ball past Krul before running away in celebration. Gouffran is penalised for a clumsy tackle on Aaron Lennon. Kone is being given the time and space to dictate play in the middle of the park but his final pass leaves a lot to be desired. Ayoze Perez came on at half-time in place of Obertan. A positive move by John Carver, who will feel his side can get something out of today's game. Just to recap, here's how McCarthy scored his first goal of the season for Everton. That strike could be pivotal in terms of the Toffees' hopes of staying in the Premier League. A nervous Everton side go into the interval with a 1-0 lead. McCarthy's goal was somewhat fortunate as Krul should have done a lot better but the Toffees will take any kind of fortune given this position in the league. The home crowd are starting to vent their frustrations at Everton despite still being in the lead. Toffees fans will be desperate for their side to open up a two-goal lead in order to ensure they take all three points. The Toffees have grown in confidence since taking the lead through McCarthy. Kone appears to be enjoying a free role just behind Lukaku, while the Belgium international is holding the ball up well. Baines is starting to have some joy down the left. Janmaat is struggling to deal with Baines' runs from deeps. The England left back could have some joy today. Nice moment at Goodison Park. Jonas Gutierrez has just started warming up, running alongside the Family Enclosure towards the Gwladys Street end, both of which are the domain of home supporters. As he made his way to the corner flag on his short shuttle sprint, there was spontaneous applause from Evertonians, a mark of respect for what he has been through. Everton are starting to get a real grip on this game. Ryan Taylor received a yellow card for bringing down the marauding Lennon. Good atmosphere inside Goodison Park, none of the tension that made the first 30 minutes of the Europa League contest with Dynamo Kiev so uncomfortable. Everton have had the better of the play so far and look fresher, thanks to Roberto Martinez making five changes from that 2-1 win on Thursday. It’s a big game for Everton and they look primed to get the result they need particularly now that James McCarthy has given them the lead. Lukaku holds the ball up before laying it on to McCarthy who scores his first goal of the season with a driven shot at goal. Krul committed himself to diving to his right, however McCarthy sent the ball in the opposite corner. Both sides have failed to really trouble the opposing goalkeeper in the first 17 minutes of the match. Newcastle are just shading the possession stats. Martinez will also need help from his goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has not been in the best of form this season. The former Manchester United man will surely take confidence in his early save. Everton's last home win in the Premier League came back in December when Martinez's side beat QPR 3-1. The Toffees will surely have to improve their home form if they cant to climb the table and ensure they are not involved in a relegation scrap. Lukaku, who found the back of the net against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday, stings Krul's gloves with a powerful shot at goal. He will be desperate to live up to his price-tag and help Everton pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle have started the match extremely brightly. Obertan tested Howard with a powerful effort before Williamson's shot was cleared off the line. Everton: Howard; Baines, Jagielka, Alcaraz, Coleman; McCarthy, Gibson, Lennon, Osman; Kone, Lukaku . Newcastle: Krul; Janmaat, Coloccini, Williamson, R.Taylor; Colback, Sissoko; Obertan, Gouffran, Ameobi; Riviere . The attention switches from the top half of the table to the bottom half where Everton are in desperate need of a win. Roberto Martinez's side are currently just three points away from the Barcalys Premier League drop zone. Newcastle, on the other hand, are sitting comfortably in mid-table. Everton will look to pull clear of the relegation zone in the Premier League with three points against mid-table Newcastle at Goodison Park. Roberto Martinez's side have struggled this season - a surprise given their impressive fifth-placed finish last year - and are currently only three points away from the bottom three. Newcastle, on the other hand, have been secure in mid-table for the majority of this season. They have dropped away from the clubs towards the top of the league, but still find themselves 10 points away from the relegation zone. Three points against Everton would almost certainly secure their Premier League status for another season.","James McCarthy scored past Tim Krul in the 20th minute .

Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there. Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself. Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain . Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial. Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council. Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area. But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam. School: Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later. After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds. Killer: Rogers was shot dead in August by his son-in-law and ex-lover Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured . The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims. However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed. A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers. 'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement. 'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.' The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s. Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past. He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent. Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself . Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13. It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.","EXCLUSIVE: Scott Rogers was shot dead by his ex-lover  in August .

fb14b821975891645cd8c781da001709d19d746d,"I'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years. Most of my friends hint, imply or say it's my fault for being too shallow, picky and prone to falling for bad boys. I use Tinder, the dating app synonymous with casual sex, to meet attractive men who meet my high standards. Yvette Caster, 33, had been single for four years, before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on Tinder for a week . It's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they can't even message you. If you like them you swipe right and, if they feel the same, you can chat. Most of the time I swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old (over 35), too young (under 25), too dull (into sport), too much of a party animal or simply too ugly. But, after another friend accused me of being picky, I decided to see what would happen if I swiped right to ALL men on Tinder for a week. Here's what happened. Sunday . The first day is the worst. Within a few minutes I've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos, a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants. After an hour I'm exhausted, depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80, mostly unsuitable, suitors. Monday . I get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer, a Ricky Gervais double and a range of football logos (you can put any image as your profile picture). Then a message from Tinder appears. They've noticed my promiscuous swiping and I can't 'like' another man for another 24 hours. Why would I want to? I've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am. After the first day of swiping right to all men, the London-based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages, all before 9am . Tuesday . I have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being 'too picky'. The fact they want to talk to me is a revelation. I usually have messages from two men a week, tops. Of the 22, a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice, down to earth guys. It's just a shame so few of them can spell. I haven't messaged any of them first, either, as I prefer them to do the chasing. Wednesday . It's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous. Keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing, especially when so many men are called Dave. At times I copy and paste the same message to all the guys, which is rude but it's either that or no reply. I can't quite believe so many of them are being so polite. My normal Tinder experience, picking only the hot guys, is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos. Maybe I really could find a boyfriend this way after all. Tinder clocked on to Yvette's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from 'liking' anyone else for 24 hours . Thursday . The chats have gone so well that I've given my number to three men, although I'm still doubtful about whether I could be physically attracted to them. On the one hand, this whole thing feels slightly immoral, or at least an exercise in leading men on. But on the other, if I think about my exes, I'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour, not looks. Friday . I've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates, not hook ups. One guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend. Another, who is far too young really, has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts. I'm starting to think this is the way forward. The 33-year-old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick-up lines (left), whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships . Saturday . Just because I can, I go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards (yuk), men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to Star Wars screen grabs. I also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for. In the end, none of them prove to be The One, but I did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation. Would I do it again? Why not? Some men need a chance to win your heart while others, well, they're just very bad at choosing profile pics.","London-based journalist, Yvette Caster, has been single for four years .

f411fef31493f612945f2cb1c2a5d56312083bf9,"A Los Angeles attorney and single mom who is battling terminal lung cancer that has spread to her brain is launching a campaign for the right to end her own life, in a case that echoes that of Brittany Maynard. Terminal: Christy O'Donnell, 46, is battling lung and brain cancer and now fighting to die with dignity . Christy O'Donnell, a former police officer, says she has exhausted all her medical options in her battle against Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which has masticated into a golf ball-sized tumor in her brain. Despite surviving the six months life expectancy she was given upon being diagnosed last June, the 46-year-old has been told her death will be painful, as her lungs continue to fill with fluid that will inevitably drown her. 'I think it's a terrible injustice that I don't have the choice to die in the manner I want to and instead that I'm forced to very likely die in protracted pain and I might even die alone,' O'Donnell told People magazine in a new feature. O'Donnell is now using what time she has left to support a  Death with Dignity law in California, having been inspired by Maynard, the 29-year-old California woman who moved to Oregon to take her own life last year, ending a long battle with brain cancer. O'Donnell says she wants to be able to do the same in the bed of her home in Valencia, with her 20-year-old daughter, Bailey Donorovich, holding her hand. She says her greatest fear is that her daughter will come home one day and find her mother dead. O'Donnell said she went to the doctors last year after waking up one morning and not being able to read properly. A big book worm, she had been reading before going to bed the night before, only to wake and hardly make out the letters of some words. She had her eyes checked, but the results came back fine. O'Donnell then called her physician and explain what happened, and the doctor told her to immediately go to the emergency room. Legacy: Brittany Maynard, 29, moved from California to Oregon - one of five U.S. states where terminally ill patients are legally allowed to kill themselves - to take her own life in November . An MRI and some other tests confirmed her shocking diagnosis. 'Bailey grabbed my hand and I just started crying and said, ''I'm so sorry'',' O'Donnell told People. 'What I was really saying was, ''I'm so sorry I'm going to die and leave you without a mom''.' O'Donnell underwent chemotherapy and has taken part in numerous clinical trials. However her prognosis has not changed. 'There is not anything medically we have not explored,' O'Donnell said. 'So it is not like I haven't exhausted all my options. My opinion is an informed one.' Doctors say the tumor in O'Donnell's lungs causes fluid to build up. She will soon have to undergo a painful procedure to empty the fluid, however it will fill up again almost immediately. 'There's a good likelihood (my daughter) will come home from work, come home from school, and find me dead,' an overwhelmed O'Donnell told People TV. In memoriam: Three California lawmakers are promoting right-to-die legislation with the family of Brittany Maynard (pictured with husband Dan Diaz), a terminally ill woman who ended her life early under Oregon law on November 1 . Love: Brittany Maynard and Dan Diaz married at the Beltane Ranch in California's wine country on September 29, 2012 . O'Donnell is now hoping to fight not just to stay alive until Brittany's 21st birthday in June, but for the law to allow her to die the way she wants. 'In the short amount of time I have left, I want to spend it with my daughter - she and I are doing this together - and I want to speak out in whatever way possible to start that dialogue with the public, with the legislature and the courts, and try and impact change,' O'Donnell said. O'Donnell's case is incredible similar to that of Maynard. Her family - lead by mother Debbie Ziegler - are now trying to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor. The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon, where Maynard moved before her suicide on November 1. Hoping for change: Debbie Ziegler, the mother of Brittany Maynard, speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication on Wednesday January 21, 2015, in Sacramento . The 29-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman had made her case public with online videos, saying in clips that were viewed tens of millions of times that she should have been able to legally obtain life-ending drugs in California. 'Most Californians would not be able to do what we did,' Ziegler said. 'They couldn't leave their homes; they couldn't leave their jobs; they couldn't leave their families, their friends, their pets. 'We had to do all of that. It added another layer of pain.' Maynard wrote in her final Facebook post: ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more .","Christy O'Donnell, 46, diagnosed with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma in June and given six months to live .

31aeaa9d37af35d148aa7b8ecedd9cbafda96338,"Michael Vaughan believes Alastair Cook is 'clearly bitter', and must set aside his own World Cup disappointment for the good of his England team at the start of their Ashes year. Cook claimed on Wednesday that England's decision to replace him as captain with Eoin Morgan, at the 11th hour before the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand, was proved 'probably wrong' by subsequent events. England made an embarrassing early exit at the hands of Bangladesh, before the knockout stages were under way. Alastair Cook was replaced as Engtland's one-day captain before this year's World Cup . Former captain Vaughan interprets Cook's remarks as a sign that he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened after losing his 50-over role because of his continued poor batting form. Cook will nonetheless lead England in three Tests against the West Indies, on a tour starting early next month, before returning home to face first New Zealand and then Australia this summer. BBC pundit Vaughan said: 'He's clearly bitter. 'I think that's a bad mentality to have, when you think he's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks' time.' Cook led England to a Champions Trophy final on home soil two years ago, and the top of the world rankings, but their recent one-day international record under him deteriorated. Vaughan added: 'Alastair Cook's last six captaincy jobs in (ODI) series for England, he lost every single one. 'The only series they've won was away in the West Indies, when he wasn't the captain.' Michael Vaughan claims Cook is 'bitter' about the decision to replace him as captain . Cook could only watch from afar as England beat only Scotland and Afghanistan in their World Cup campaign under Morgan, but he sensed they were 'shell-shocked' and in need of 'real leadership'. Vaughan argues Cook must move on, and start scoring prolifically again - as he has for the vast majority of his record-breaking career. 'I don't think it's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he's clearly bitter. 'He's got to clear that out of his head, because it's so important that by the time he gets to the West Indies England need him scoring runs. 'He has to score runs in the Caribbean; he has to get runs against New Zealand - so by the time the Ashes arrive in July, no one is talking about Alastair Cook's position in the Test team. 'He hasn't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years. That has to change in the West Indies.'","Alastair Cook was replaced as England's one-day captain .

b2a1f80918967220f3e85055603953f52495c81e,"A cannabis-smoking supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary has walked free from court after grooming a 15-year-old schoolgirl on Facebook. Mansoor Miah sent explicit photographs to the schoolgirl before inviting her to a hotel to have sex with him. The 22-year-old from Kilburn, north west London, even filmed himself in sordid trysts and sent them to the youngster who was using her Nintendo DS to access Facebook. He was spared jail after a court heard how Miah, who has shared several of Choudary's fundamentalist tweets, struck up an online conversation about the Koran. Mansoor Miah walked free from court after sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old schoolgirl he was grooming over social media . When she told him she was uninterested in religion Miah, who worked in Tesco, carried on their conversations which turned to a sexual nature despite the girl having told him how old she was. He was handed a suspended sentence of 16 months at Southward Crown Court today. Earlier the court heard how he began speaking to the girl about Islam but soon forced the conversation in a sexual direction. 'Having talked about Islam, undeterred, Mr Miah began to chat the complainant up,' prosecutor Stephen Requena said. 'Having talked about Islam he proceeds to chat her up, having established her real age. 'He praises her physical appearance and asks if she has a boyfriend.' The court heard how he sent her explicit photographs of himself, urging her to do the same before performing a sex act in front of her on webcam. He was arrested last year after one of the girl's teachers told her mother of their plans to meet in a Premier Inn in Kent. 'The mother, it seems, was scared and felt her daughter was in danger when this was discovered. The 22-year-old is a supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary having shared some of the cleric's posts on Twitter . 'She describes her daughter as not that mature, which leaves her vulnerable,' added Mr Requena. The youngster was said to have had her laptop confiscated after engaging in explicit conversations with men on social media before meeting Miah. In a statement provided by her mother she was described as 'shy' and and 'uncomfortable' with new people. Despite admitting to knowing the girl was underage, Miah claimed that he did not target her, adding: 'She looks 20.' Support: Miah is a fan of Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary (above) 'He didn’t seek her out, he befriended her because she was a friend of a friend, not because she looks young, she looks 20,' said hi barrister Edward Jones said. 'This was a young man confused about religious beliefs, smoking cannabis to significant degree. He has now sought to reform himself. 'He made a catastrophic error of judgement which he said would not be repeated.' Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said while the defendant had planned 'some sort of sexual activity', he was not a 'predatory paedophile'. 'You have not repeated this offence, so there is no evidence you are a predatory paedophile of the type I’m afraid we often see in this court, and the fact you didn't try again allows me to accept you were remorseful for your behaviour months before the police intervened. 'A suspended sentence is appropriate. 'A prison sentence to mark the seriousness of what you did, and a course of treatment to ensure it doesn't happen again and to protect young girls.' The judge added that if the pair had met up at the hotel or if Miah had approached another girl his sentence would have been more severe. 'The victim was just 15 and was young for her age, her mother said she was vulnerable and not streetwise. 'You had no sexual experience. You were feeling depressed and isolated, you were smoking cannabis. 'I accept you were immature for your age and once these conversations were finished you did not talk to other girls.' He also praised him for being 'helpful' to the police, who described him as a 'different person' from the one who had committed the offences. Miah was also put on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order. .","Mansoor Miah contacted the girl over social media as she played Nintendo .

The post also counseled that, despite 2015 marking two years since San Francisco's controversial nudity ban, no one has been cited during a naked ride. That appeared to have remained the case with Saturday's ride. However, the same wasn't true for a group of pro-nudity protesters last month when a demonstration in the Castro District was called to mark the second anniversary of the city law, which bans public nudity except at events whose sponsors obtain permits.

Officers said the trio had to be taken into custody instead of being cited because they did not have identification.

3a80ed1ae9e57130e636330a9c55227a325eba47,"Nicola Tweedy, 54, died two days after she had her varicose veins operated on at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital . The death of a woman days after she underwent surgery on her varicose veins could have been prevented, her husband has today claimed. Nicola Tweedy, 54, had the operation at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in March last year and was discharged the same evening. But two days later the mother-of-two was found apparently asleep in her chair at the family home in Pulham Market, Norfolk. When her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant, they called an ambulance. Despite the best efforts of the paramedics called, Mrs Tweedy died. A post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot which reached her lungs. An inquest heard staff at the hospital failed to ensure Mrs Tweedy was fully aware of the risk of suffering a blood clot during the operation, because of an 'oversight'. Her husband, Chris Tweedy, 53, said he is now considering taking civil action against the hospital, claiming he believes his wife's death could have been prevented. The postman, who lives with the couple's two children, said: 'They were required to avoid harming her and, tragically, in my opinion, they did not.' South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said the case was a 'tragedy' which should prompt improvements. He added: 'It is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for Mrs Tweedy, most crucially to place Mrs Tweedy and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation. 'Any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly. People are only human. 'But in the post-Mid Staffs world, when things have been less than perfect, patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness.' Consultant vascular surgeon Robert Brightwell admitted to the inquest in Norwich that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed. That meant the 54-year-old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery, including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index. Nurse Susan Brown said she accepted it was 'an oversight' and that a checklist had not been completed on the patient's discharge notes. Coroner Jacqueline Lake gave a narrative conclusion that Mrs Tweedy died following a 'rare but recognised' risk of surgery, adding she will write a report so that future deaths may be prevented. She said she was satisfied that the operation itself had been conducted appropriately. But raised concerns that Mrs Tweedy had not been given the correct leaflets on her care. Speaking after the inquest Mr Tweedy said his family's lives had been 'damaged beyond repair'. He described his wife and his 'happy, smiling soul-mate'. Mrs Tweedy's husband, Chris, 53, who lives with the couple's two children, said he believes his wife's death could have been prevented . A post mortem examination revealed Mrs Tweedy died of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in her lungs . He added: 'Nicky was a happy, smiling, laughing, easy going, fun loving person all of her life. 'She was someone who loved, cared for, guided, supported and helped so many people throughout her life. 'In my opinion, the Norfolk and Norwich  would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife's death, and to materially revise their protocols and procedures, which they have subsequently done, without my formal complaint and, even after that, without the very considerable pressure I have placed upon them, both personally and through other organisations. 'In the United Kingdom thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism. 'Many thousands more have to live with the life changing consequences. 'That, in my opinion, is a national scandal.' A hospital spokeswoman expressed sympathy to the Tweedy family. She added: 'Mrs Tweedy died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery, estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases, in other words one in 10,000 patients. 'While it is possible to reduce the risks of surgery they can never be eliminated entirely. 'The trust commissioned an independent review in order to identify any ways in which we could improve our services. 'Once we have the coroner's recommendations we will review these to identify any further opportunities for improvement.' Lawyer Sharon Allison, of Ashton KCJ which represented the family, said: 'My client and his family are understandably devastated beyond words at their loss. 'They have many questions relating to the hospital's protocols concerning blood clotting risks.' An inquest heard how a pre-surgery risk assessment was not completed, meaning Mrs Tweedy was not fully aware of the risks of suffering a blood clot during her operation .","Nicola Tweedy had an operation on her varicose veins last March .

The indications are that Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground tomorrow, but the last thing he needs is another desperate defeat by minnows. The fact England turned up early yesterday for what used to be known as naughty-boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their need to take something from their worst-ever World Cup. Victory against Afghanistan would perhaps give Moores breathing space before the squad is announced on Tuesday for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moores attempts to rally his troops on the SCG on Wednesday ahead of their match against Afghanistan . Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the defeat by Bangladesh while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his left foot. It is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup: James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, who could then be making their final ODI appearances. After the World Cup England must start from scratch with a one-day squad who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in persevering in 50-over cricket beyond tomorrow with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson, who said on Wednesday he wants to play on. His is not a view shared by former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior. Young England quick Chris Jordan works up a sweat during a tough day of training in the Sydney sunshine . In his Evening Standard column Prior wrote: ‘Men like Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad... remain key members of the Test side, so perhaps it is time for them to concentrate solely on that form of the game, especially with an Ashes summer approaching.’ There is a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team in coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman. He would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland and said: ‘We still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order. If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock.’","Former England opener Mark Butcher told fans not to watch the Ashes .

Padge-Victoria Windslowe's testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose was 'a walking billboard' for her work. However, the former 'Black Madam' had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service. Today, she was found guilty of third-degree murder after one of her 'patients', Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London break-dancer and college student, died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks. Scroll down for video . Conviction: Padge-Victoria Windslowe (left), who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women, has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed Claudia Aderotimi (right) Former madam: Windslowe, a former 'Black Madam' (pictured) had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service . Miss Aderotimi, who paid $2,000 to be injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died just a few hours later. It was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart. During her murder trial, Windslowe said of her 'body sculpting': 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon. The 45-year-old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service, as well as a Gothic hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Black Madam.' Last week, her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains. She has been in prison since 2012 after an 18-month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant. The jury got the case Friday. They were choosing between third-degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter, involving reckless disregard for a person's life. Aspiring hip-hop artists: Today, the defendant (pictured left and right) was convicted of third-degree murder after Miss Aderotimi, 20, a London dancer and college student, died from a silicone injection in her buttocks . Tragic death: Miss Aderotimi (pictured), who was injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in the city in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died a few hours later . In addition to third-degree murder, Windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a Philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections. And the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial-grade silicone. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone. Miss Aderotimi's family in England chose not to attend the trial. The long-time friend who accompanied her to Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip. The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as 'a touch-up' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as 'Lillian.' Windslowe name-dropped the likes of rappers Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and athlete Serena Williams during her testimony. She also claimed to have been baptized 'Genevieve' by the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. Amber Rose's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client. The evidence showed that Windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and 'pumping parties' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse: a water bottle filled with silicone, a red plastic cup, needles and syringes, and Krazy Glue to close the injection sites. Claims: Windslowe's colorful testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose (pictured) was 'a walking billboard' for her untrained work . There have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections. A mother of three who died in Texas after having work done at a tile store died in April 2011. A Columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case. Windslowe, who went on the run after Miss Aderotimi's death, lowered her head during the closing arguments Friday as a prosecutor described her victim as 'a regular girl' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children. When Miss Aderotimi began having chest pains afterward, Windslowe 'kept up that ruse' of being a physician's assistant, Assistant District Attorney Bridget Kirn told the jury last week. 'She put her hand on this young lady's chest as if she were doing an exam,' Kirn said. 'But there was no exam.' Addressing the court, defense lawyer David Rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client, Windslowe, because she only knew of satisfied customers. 'Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky,' Rudenstein told the court. 'We know that now. But we didn't know that then.'","Padge-Victoria Windslowe convicted of third-degree murder by jury today .

811d53b2ea2852190f5b1da3f163dcc18e24a746,"(CNN)""There's a baby. There's a baby."" The frantic voices of rescuers can be heard on the body cam video showing the moment baby Lily was found one week ago. The 18-month-old girl hangs upside down after her mother's car crashed and flipped into a frigid Utah river some 14 hours earlier. A firefighter is seen lifting her tiny body, wrapped in pink, from the red car where Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, lost her life. The car landed on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. From the murky waters, the rescuer hands baby Lily to a police officer. He dashes up the rocky banks of the Spanish Fork, pressing the infant close to his chest for warmth. ""Got it,"" the officer is heard saying. Lily is freezing. ""Come on, baby,"" he says. ""She's definitely hypothermic."" In the ambulance, the officer pats little Lily on the back in an attempt to get her breathing. Lily is on her side. She looks pale, her tiny arm appears stiff. ""Come on, sweetie,"" the officer implores. ""Come on, sweetie."" On the ambulance to a hospital, rescuers perform CPR. They try to warm her. ""We're almost there,"" one rescuer is heard to say. ""Are you getting a pulse?"" ""I can't feel anything,"" says another. At the hospital, as Lily is rushed into the emergency room, she vomits. ""We've been doing CPR on her,"" the officer tells emergency room personnel. ""She's been throwing up a little bit."" Those moments captured by the body cam video -- which first aired on CNN affiliate KSL -- were crucial. ""If anything had been different, she might not have made it,"" emergency room doctor Brock Royall told the station. In the ER, Lily opened her eyes as CPR was performed to get her heart pumping, Royall said. Another important factor was a car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age, and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside-down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but even more dangerous if the baby had gotten wet. ""She seems to be doing great,"" said Officer Jason Howard of the Spanish Fork Police Department. ""We were able to get together with her and her family. She was happy and smiling. Seemed to be a normal and happy, healthy baby."" Howard said the toddler temporarily was staying with an aunt and uncle. Her father, Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. ""(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home."" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. ""She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,"" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot last Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: ""I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that."" But he also considers himself lucky to still have his daughter -- healthy and alive. ""I'm just blessed. I'm counting all my blessings right now,"" said Trafny.

504b5538a98febc571f24cf6cbeec730e380511b,"The damning thing for Leicester in this match they really needed to win was that there was no cavalry charge, no guns blazing crescendo. Tom Huddlestone was dismissed for second bookable offence with 18 minutes to go but Allan McGregor in the Hull goal had not one meaningful save to make as the clock ticked down. In fact, it was Mark Schwarzer who had to be alert. In the final minute he reacted expertly to stop an Abel Hernandez shot following a quickly-taken free-kick by Dame N’Doye. Had that gone in, the obituaries on Leicester’s Premier League life could have been signed off.

Leicester are seven points from safety, even if Sunderland are dropping like a stone having played a game more. Leicester’s match in hand is against Chelsea. Martin O’Neill was at the King Power Stadium as a guest of the club he served so well in two League Cup triumphs. This season is heading for a more sombre conclusion to those heady days. Nigel Pearson is realistic, knowing uncommon improvement is needed immediately. ‘We’ve got ten games left, six at home, we probably need to win five,’ he said having seen his side win only four times all campaign. ‘When the pressure was on us to go and create I don’t think we did. We were laboured.’ Steve Bruce was disappointed at a different aspect, the clamour for a card from Leicester players when Alex Bruce tackled Riyad Mahrez in the second half. The ball was won but referee Jon Moss produced a yellow, soon after erring similarly in booking Craig Dawson. Leicester City keeper Mark Schwarzer punches clear as Dame N'Doye of Hull and Ritchie De Laet of the Foxes vie for the ball . ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make,’ said Bruce. ‘If we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ When a game begins with six centre-halves on the pitch there is a reasonable assumption goals will be in short supply. Jake Livermore of Hull attempts to keep possession at the King Power Stadium under pressure from Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso . Leicester matched Hull in a 3-5-2 formation, with half a dozen genuine defenders concentrating solely on keeping the ball away from danger. They did their jobs well, in a contest that began so short on opportunities or entertainment mass narcolepsy was an entirely possible outcome. It took Leicester until 62 minutes to register a shot on target, and even that was a mishit cross by Jamie Vardy, requiring a palm over from McGregor. Hull were only marginally better, but should have gone ahead in the 20th minute only for Nikica Jelavic to get himself in a terrible tangle. In a contender for miss of the season, he failed to put boot to ball from six yards with the net open. Huddlestone chipped the ball over the backline of blue shirts to find Ahmed Elmohamady sprinting clear, having timed his run perfectly to stay onside. The Egyptian squared the ball to take out Schwarzer but Jelavic failed badly. Six minutes later he did have the ball in the back of the net. But Moss had already blown for a foul on Schwarzer by N’Doye. Leicester’s best opening of the first-half came in the 34th minute when Mahrez delivered a wicked cross that bent into the area in front of Andrej Kramaric. But the £9million striker was either caught on his heels or disinclined to make the leap required to meet the ball and it drifted wide. Tom Huddlestone puts in a robust challenge on Leicester City striker Andrej Kramaric during the Premier League clash on Saturday . Referee Jonathan Moss hands out the yellow card to Hull City defender Alex Bruce (left) as tempers threatened to boil over . This was a bad game for Kramaric, unable to affect it in any way and he was hooked for Leonardo Ulloa after an hour. Soon after Jelavic headed over from a corner by Gaston Ramirez. That is when Leicester began to make a more concerted effort to win three points rather than one. Vardy was a nuisance all match for the Hull defenders, his pace and energy unsettling. It was he who stretched his legs down the left before cutting in and forcing Huddlestone into a foul he wished not to make. He tried to back out of it but the contact sent Vardy to the floor. Abel Hernandez of Hull City has his head in his hands after a missed chance to fire the Tigers into the lead at the King Power Stadium . Moss, soon after dishing out two wholy incorrect bookings for ‘fouls’ by Dawson and Bruce, got this yellow right. From the free-kick Jeff Schlupp struck a shot that was heading in until Ulloa inadvertently blocked. With the man advantage Leicester pressed but without cultivating anything to truly worry Bruce. The crowd willed the ball in for the final few minutes but boos greeted the final whistle. This felt like a fatal opportunity missed.","Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone sent off in the second-half for two bookable offences .

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo González, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, said: 'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.' The researchers coated Tronchon cheese (labelled queso Tronchon recubierto) with a combination of chitosan, which is extracted from crustacean shells, and essential oils from rosemary and oregano .","Russian photographer Nick Larionstev captured a video of mould growing .

Myers' body was found in Cactus Park, Mesa County on February 28. The teenager had been missing since December 18. Kelly Mae Myers, 18, died of a 'mixed drug intoxication', according to the Mesa County Coroner's office. Her body was found stuffed in a suitcase at a Colorado park on February 28 . Police say Eduardo De La Cruz, 30 (left) was staying at the same hotel where Myers died. Raymond Cordova, 47 (right), an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house and allegedly dumped her body . Colorado police ruled her death as 'suspicious' but have not yet officially declared it a homicide. Officials said they would not release any more information regarding Myters' cause of death at this time because of the ongoing investigation, according to Fox 13 Now. Myers' body was put inside a suitcase and kept in a West Valley City hotel before it was transported to the Cactus Park area, a search warrant obtained by The Deseret News revealed. Police are currently investigating two persons of interest, Eduardo De La Cruz and Raymond Cordova,  in connection with Myers' disappearance. De La Cruz, 30, is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin but is not an official suspect in the Myers case, police said. Myers' body was found stuffed in a suitcase at Cactus Park in Mesa County, Colorado, on February 28, two months after police believe the teen died at a West Valley City hotel . He was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'. De La Cruz was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation. Myers was last seen in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City for a party. Relatives who reported her missing in Colorado said the teenager's disappearance was 'out of character'. Myers' mother Kim Lee told Fox 13 Now she had never heard of De La Cruz or Cordova before they were arrested. 'This wasn't just a piece of trash that you stuffed, and I hate saying that word, but you put in a suitcase,' she said. 'This was a human being, this was my daughter.' Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, a police affidavit stated. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel in West Valley City. De La Cruz had checked into the hotel the day Myers is believed to have died, police say. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel . An informant told police Myers' body was placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell' and that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase, according to The Deseret News. He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'. They then drove to Cactus Park and disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states. On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. The housekeeper added that it smelled 'as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states. Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail for investigation of drug-related charges. Myers  had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine and police initially believed she had fled Colorado for Utah. Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. A search team was not sent out for the teenager until January 19. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time.

Lamis Khamis, 42, was behind the wheel of her black 2.0 litre Audi when she got into a row with a man riding an electric-powered bicycle at a roundabout near Shepherd's Bush Green, in London. After the man kicked her car, Khamis followed him and drove her car into him at low speed, knocking him off his bike. Fashion designer to the stars Lamis Khamis has been fined £600 after she followed a cyclist in her car and deliberately knocked him over after the pair had argued and he kicked her Audi on a London roundabout . Khamis was fined £600 after a judge ruled that on her part 'it should not be described as road rage', but added that the cyclist could have been injured. The designer launched her own brand in 2001 after she graduated from Camberwell College of Arts. She set up a stall to sell her wares in Portobello Market in London and has since then attracted the attention of model Cara Delevingne, who has been pictured wearing her designs, Paris Hilton and musician Chris Brown. At a hearing at Isleworth Crown Court Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and a valid MOT on May 17. The fashion designer, who graduated from the Camberwell College of Arts, has worked with celebrities including Rita Ora (pictured) Model Cara Delevingne is pictured wearing a Lamis Khamis creation (left), while Katie Price worked with the designer in 2011 on fashion line Day 22, which she promoted on the Pure Spirit catwalk (right) The court heard that after the cyclist kicked the side of her car as they argued at the roundabout he made a dent, costing around £300 to repair. Recorder John Gallagher said: 'He rode off, but because his cycle had no registration plate you followed in an attempt to obtain details from him. 'You, in an attempt to stop him, drove into him and he fell off his cycle. Your actions were deliberate, but it was not a case of running a person down because you were only travelling at 10mph and he sustained no injuries. Lamis Khamis is pictured with Paris Hilton (centre), who is a fan of her designs and Sam Pemberton (left) 'However, this was a deliberate act and he might well have been injured and you did not consider the risks and alternatives.' Mr Gallagher also gave Khamis six penalty points on her licence. But he added: 'You are a mature lady who has never been in trouble with the police in the past and you have a clean driving licence and in twenty years have had no disqualifications.' The court heard that the prosecution had previously dropped a more serious charge of dangerous driving. Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and was fined, after the judge ruled the incident was not one of road rage, but that the victim could have been injured in the incident .","Lamis Khamis was driving in Shepherd's Bush when she got into an argument with a man on an electric bicycle who kicked her black Audi .

He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media.
